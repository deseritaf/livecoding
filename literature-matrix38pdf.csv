The sample for this study consisted of 20 first-year middle-school students who participated in theme selection activities in a free semester program as part of their home economics studies. The data for the study consisted of nine class observation logs, four group activity outputs, 30 class results, an online survey, and in-depth interviews with three students. A program called “R.U.OK” was developed by setting problematic situation for school violence prevention linked to the contents of the Home Economics Education(HEE) curriculum. After the program was implemented, the survey on the students’ class satisfaction content elements, with AI-based learning activities and PBL and interest, displayed high points, with an average of 4.0 or higher. Our qualitative analysis produced four significant results. First, students’ concerns about school violence had increased and they showed a change in attitude, having more empathy with friends and more interest in their surroundings. Second, digital and AI literacy had improved, and students’ interest in digital media learning had increased. Third, there had been an improvement in problem-solving ability in terms of being able to think more critically and independently. Fourth, the results also demonstrated that there had been a positive effect on self-direction and an improved capacity for teamwork.

As shown in Fig. 3, the summary of included papers according to their year of publication. The papers focusing on K-12 AI/ML increased significantly from 2018 to 2020. Publication on the subject was almost inexistence from 2010 to 2016 and no publication was recorded at all in the year 2017. This trend occurred because the field is still emerging and growing while the high volume of publications produced in 2020 shows increased interest in the research area. The rapid increase of output in 2019 and 2020 suggests more publications in this research area in the coming years due to the activeness of researchers towards the emerging field in recent times as well as the increasing need to democratize AI or ML and involve children.

Our findings reveal that ML resources were designed and utilized across K-12 settings 

This paper aims to aggregate the ML research in K-12 system that have been investigated 

We propose that scholars and K-12 AI/ML practitioners consider the following takeaways when designing ML activities or studies: (a) create more ML activities for kindergarten to middle school, development of teacher training, and education in an informal context; (b) incorporate ML ideas in subject domains other than computing to encourage the integration of ML in schools; (c) develop assessment for ML that can be relevant across levels for students’ comparability in ML understanding across learning settings (d) consider societal and ethical implications of ML to better understand students’ proficiency of ML; (e) conduct studies focusing on Africa as well as comparative studies exploring different regions to understand how to better introduce ML across climes 

Given that ML has been introduced across K-12 levels, creating a catalog that houses the activities, platforms, and assessments for stakeholders in need of the ML resources would be valuable for the development of the growing field 

Longitudinal pedagogical research should be considered as it can expand on the understanding of how computational thinking and understanding of machine learning develop in a process of learning (Vartiainen et al, 2020a, 2020b) 

Most studies center on supervised machine learning, on classification tasks, which is regarded as the simplest ML form 

Many studies recognize limited learning material or resources, and this suggests that future research should design integrated and AI resources that could be adopted in varying contexts with students, novices, pre-service and in-service teachers

;ActiveAI: Introducing AI Literacy for Middle School Learners with Goal-based Scenario Learning Ying Jui Tseng, Gautam Yadav Carnegie Mellon University yingjuit@andrew.cmu.edu;Brief Abstract;;2022;;The ActiveAI project addresses key challenges in AI education for grades 7-9 students by providing an engaging AI literacy learning experience based on the AI4K12 knowledge framework. Utilizing learning science mechanisms such as goal-based scenarios, immediate feedback, project-based learning, and intelligent agents, the app incorporates a variety of learner inputs like sliders, steppers, and collectors to enhance understanding. In these courses, students work on real-world scenarios like analyzing sentiment in social media comments. This helps them learn to effectively engage with AI systems and develop their ability to evaluate AI-generated output. The Learning Engineering Process (LEP) guided the project's creation and data instrumentation, focusing on design and impact. The project is currently in the implementation stage, leveraging the intelligent tutor design principles for app development. The extended abstract presents the foundational design and development, with further evaluation and research to be conducted in the future.;Learning Engineering;big idea;;;;;;Student performance on assessments will improve after using the AI literacy app;;"ActiveAI project offers 7-9 grade students an engaging and accessible AI learning experience, grounded in AI4K12’s five big ideas (Touretzky et al, 2022). These five big ideas include ""Perception,"" ""Representation &amp; Reasoning,"" ""Learning,"" ""Natural Interaction,"" and ""Societal Impact."" The objective is to foster an understanding of AI concepts and applications in an ever-changing technological landscape 

The design of ActiveAI relies on proven learning science mechanisms and a range of learner inputs to engage students and promote in-depth understanding 

Goal-based scenarios: ActiveAI adopts a goal-oriented approach, offering a range of scenarios in which students tackle real-world challenges that call for AI principles and methodologies (Schank et al, 1994) 

3. Project-based learning: ActiveAI encourages students to work on authentic hands-on projects that require the application of AI concepts and skills 

Studies have demonstrated that incorporating intelligent agents in educational settings can effectively engage middle school learners and promote the development of AI literacy skills (Rodríguez-García et al, 2020) 

5. Learner input: ActiveAI strategically employs a select set of learner input interactions – sliders, steppers, and collectors – to facilitate student engagement and comprehension of complex AI concepts 

By limiting the interactions to these three types, the app ensures a consistent and familiar interaction across the system, reducing the learning curve and allowing students to focus on mastering AI Literacy concepts without the need to constantly adapt to new interaction styles 

The data collected from students' app interactions will be analyzed to answer research questions related to design and impact (Torrence, 2022), providing insights into the learning experience's effectiveness and continuous improvement 

Student performance on assessments will improve after using the AI literacy app

To empower children growing up with AI to navigate society’s evolving sociotechnical context, we developed three middle school AI literacy curricula: Creative AI, Dancing with AI, and How to Train Your Robot. In this paper we discuss how we leveraged three design principles—active learning, embedded ethics, and low barriers to access – to effectively engage students in learning to create and critique AI artifacts. During the summer of 2020, we recruited and trained in-service, middle school teachers from across the United States to co-instruct online workshops with students from their schools. In the workshops, a combination of hands-on unplugged and programming activities facilitated students’ understanding of AI. As students explored technical concepts in tandem with ethical ones, they developed a critical lens to better grasp how AI systems work and how they impact society. We sought to meet the specified needs of students from a range of backgrounds by minimizing the prerequisite knowledge and technology resources students needed to participate. Finally, we conclude with lessons learned and design recommendations for future AI curricula, especially for K-12 in-person and virtual learning.;machine learning;Curriculum;generative adversarial networks;Middle-school;curricula;;;"This paper describes how we designed and executed three project-based curricula in an online learning environment to make Artificial Intelligence education more accessible to middle school students

The necessity of AI literacy, comprising knowledge and skills for critical interaction with AI, is increasingly important. Multilingual learners, engaging with both every day and domain-specific vocabulary and syntax, must acquire AI literacy, necessitating tailored pedagogical practices. This article outlines three strategies implemented for multilingual middle school students during a summer camp in Southern California. We argue for a mutually beneficial relationship between acquiring second language proficiency and AI literacy. Supporting these processes, we present three pedagogical strategies: (1) storytelling to model AI decision-making, (2) role-playing as an AI to demonstrate programmability and learning from data, and (3) programming text-to-speech-to-text AI to illustrate sensor functionality and action-reaction concepts. Additionally, we discuss their alignment with AI competencies. These strategies potentially foster linguistic scaffolding and translanguaging, aiding multilingual learners in acquiring new literacies.;AI literacy;second language;ChatGPT;Storytelling;middle school;;;"We have outlined three Artificial intelligence literacy pedagogical strategies developed for a 4-week summer camp in Southern California, targeting elementary and middle school multilingual students 

We conclude that employing conversational agents as AI examples effectively addresses multiple AI competencies, while simultaneously leveraging the multilingual speech and writing skills of students. These agents, being inherently language-driven AI technologies, offer a rich platform for engagement and discourse. Storytelling proved to be a powerful tool for multilingual students, enabling them to practice decision-making, a crucial aspect in both narrative creation and AI technology. Personifying AI encourages students to familiarize themselves with AI-specific vocabulary such as databases, training, testing, and accuracy, and to contemplate how AI systems learn from data. Additionally, programming activities involving the conversion of modalities, like speech and text, allowed students to explore how AI perceives and generates speech. Looking forward, we plan to systematically evaluate these pedagogical strategies' impact on AI literacy learning and investigate how multilingual students utilize their linguistic abilities to engage with and learn about AI.";The camp attracted over 40 students, with more than 90% being Latine and Spanish-speaking, from the surrounding middle- to low-income communities;"We recognize that this article does not offer findings from empirical research; instead, it merges a review of AI literacy concepts with insights gained from our experience in the design and execution of a curriculum for the summer camp

preprint;Build-a-Bot: Teaching Conversational AI Using a Transformer-Based Intent Recognition and Question Answering Architecture;"Kate Pearce; Sharifa Alghowinem; Cynthia Breazeal";;2022;;As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a prominent part of modern life, AI literacy is becoming important for all citizens, not just those in technology careers. Previous research in AI education materials has largely focused on the introduction of terminology as well as AI use cases and ethics, but few allow students to learn by creating their own machine learning models. Therefore, there is a need for enriching AI educational tools with more adaptable and flexible platforms for interested educators with any level of technical experience to utilize within their teaching material. As such, we propose the development of an open-source tool (Build-a-Bot) for students and teachers to not only create their own transformer-based chatbots based on their own course material, but also learn the fundamentals of AI through the model creation process. The primary concern of this paper is the creation of an interface for students to learn the principles of artificial intelligence by using a natural language pipeline to train a customized model to answer questions based on their own school curriculums. The model uses contexts given by their instructor, such as chapters of a textbook, to answer questions and is deployed on an interactive chatbot/voice agent. The pipeline teaches students data collection, data augmentation, intent recognition, and question answering by having them work through each of these processes while creating their AI agent, diverging from previous chatbot work where students and teachers use the bots as black-boxes with no abilities for customization or the bots lack AI capabilities, with the majority of dialogue scripts being rule-based. In addition, our tool is designed to make each step of this pipeline intuitive for students at a middle-school level. Further work primarily lies in providing our tool to schools and seeking student and teacher evaluations.;natural language;BERT;STEM;artificial intelligence;open source;;;"We created a pipeline with multiple transformers to generate natural language answers to student questions; we used this pipeline to make an open-source tool to enable students to learn the supervised learning process by training the models in the pipeline 

In this paper, we created a pipeline with multiple transformers to generate natural language answers to student questions; moreover, we used this pipeline to make an open-source tool to enable students to learn the supervised learning process by training the models in the pipeline. The tool is inexpensive to use and practical for a classroom environment, as instructors can download the tool as an executable file and deploy it without any programming knowledge. This enables educators of any level of technical experience to build their students’ AI literacy with a curriculum based around constructivist learning theory. Students also build system engineering and analysis skills by engaging with and modifying the multi-step language pipeline. Further work involves presenting results of the efficacy of the language modeling used and piloting the tool in classroom settings. We also hope to expand access by making our tool usable by all operating systems and improving documentation.";;"Much of the current work in artificial intelligence (AI) education centers around curriculum design and classroom implementation – for example, MIT’s AI Ethics for Middle School curriculum focuses on showing students examples of AI that most of them regularly use, developing their programmatic thinking skills, and raising their awareness of ethical issues concerning AI like algorithmic bias (Williams et al 2022) 

Current literature is primarily focused on lesson and activity design to introduce students to AI terminology and the computational mindset (Kim et al 2021) as well as broad perspective and ethical issues related to AI (Wollowski et al 2016) 

While previous research has focused on curriculum development, this paper proposes a tool for AI education that would allow students to explore the supervised learning process by creating their own chatbots using a transformer-based language pipeline 

Existing curriculums to build AI literacy at the elementary and middle school level largely focus on programmatic thinking and applications of AI: Google’s Teachable Machine is a popular tool to demonstrate the process of learning from a dataset, and students may be more directly instructed on examples of AI seen in daily life, like YouTube’s recommendation system (Sabuncuoglu 2020) 

Build-a-Bot implements these methodologies in its design; students learn by studying and modifying a complex language system, rather than being directly instructed on AI principles 

When BERT is fine-tuned with a smaller set of labeled data, it can be used for a variety of natural language tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis 

When using Build-a-Bot, students train their own BERT model for intent recognition based on questions that they write and label 

A BERT-based architecture trained on the student question dataset is used for the intent recognition model, with the number of epochs set by the students while they learn about model training 

We created a pipeline with multiple transformers to generate natural language answers to student questions; we used this pipeline to make an open-source tool to enable students to learn the supervised learning process by training the models in the pipeline

journal-article;Co‐designing teacher support technology for problem‐based learning in middle school science;"Nicole Hutchins; Gautam Biswas";British Journal of Educational Technology;2023;10.1111/bjet.13363;Abstract This paper provides an experience report on a co‐design approach with teachers to co‐create learning analytics‐based technology to support problem‐based learning in middle school science classrooms. We have mapped out a workflow for such applications and developed design narratives to investigate the implementation, modifications and temporal roles of the participants in the design process. Our results provide precedent knowledge on co‐designing with experienced and novice teachers and co‐constructing actionable insight that can help teachers engage more effectively with their students' learning and problem‐solving processes during classroom PBL implementations. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Success of educational technology depends in large part on the technology's alignment with teachers' goals for their students, teaching strategies and classroom context. Teacher and researcher co‐design of educational technology and supporting curricula has proven to be an effective way for integrating teacher insight and supporting their implementation needs. Co‐designing learning analytics and support technologies with teachers is difficult due to differences in design and development goals, workplace norms, and AI‐literacy and learning analytics background of teachers. What this paper adds We provide a co‐design workflow for middle school teachers that centres on co‐designing and developing actionable insights to support problem‐based learning (PBL) by systematic development of responsive teaching practices using AI‐generated learning analytics. We adapt established human‐computer interaction (HCI) methods to tackle the complex task of classroom PBL implementation, working with experienced and novice teachers to create a learning analytics dashboard for a PBL curriculum. We demonstrate researcher and teacher roles and needs in ensuring co‐design collaboration and the co‐construction of actionable insight to support middle school PBL. Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics researchers will be able to use the workflow as a tool to support their PBL co‐design processes. Learning analytics researchers will be able to apply adapted HCI methods for effective co‐design processes. Co‐design teams will be able to pre‐emptively prepare for the difficulties and needs of teachers when integrating middle school teacher feedback during the co‐design process in support of PBL technologies.;problem-based learning;actionable insight;middle school;curricula;analytics;;;This paper provides an experience report on a co‐design approach with teachers to co‐create learning analytics‐based technology to support problem‐based learning in middle school science classrooms;Our results provide precedent knowledge on co‐designing with experienced and novice teachers and co‐constructing actionable insight that can help teachers engage more effectively with their students' learning and problem‐solving processes during classroom PBL implementations;"Whereas it is important to generate analytics that highlight the different approaches students take in problem solving, it is important to help teachers customize these characterizations in ways that they can convert them into actionable information to aid classroom instruction in open-ended PBL contexts, and to support students who have difficulties individually and in small groups 

Researchers are provided enriched opportunities to learn from teacher experience to more clearly understand teaching activities, processes, and goals that can serve as the basis for defining technology requirements (Matuk et al, 2016), which is important as we develop technologies to facilitate the complex task of engaging in students’ problem-based learning (Chen et al, 2021) 

By presenting the details of the design and development process, our research aims to contribute precedent knowledge (Oxman, 1994) of useful co-design and development approaches for instructor-support technology for PBL curricula in K-12 classrooms 

The teachers were from different urban and rural locations in Tennessee, Illinois, Virginia, New York, Wyoming, and the US Virgin Islands. They were recruited based on their prior collaborations with the research team, and to ensure we had a variety of locations and experience with the PBL curriculum 

For the purpose of evaluating the co-design processes, this paper focuses on an analysis of the Define Actionable Insight and Enact Responsive Pedagogy phases of the design process (Figure 2) 

We identified key insights from these design narratives to target our goal of providing precedent knowledge for future co-design research with K-12 teachers and support future co-design work for technology enhanced PBL environments and tools 

The focus was on gaining a better understanding of middle school STEM teacher needs for implementing the PBL curriculum in their classrooms 

The activity events provided teachers opportunities to express their needs, preferences, and concerns in different formats, reason about the curricular application from both a teacher and a student perspective, and reflect on their own personal experiences with the curriculum as students in ways that allowed them to reason about the learning analytics provided across the multiple-linked curricular representations 

Our results provide precedent knowledge on co‐designing with experienced and novice teachers and co‐constructing actionable insight that can help teachers engage more effectively with their students' learning and problem‐solving processes during classroom PBL implementations

When discussing the data used and the analytics presented, teachers often asked significant questions about the process of taking logged action data and using it to group students based on common problem-solving strategies. While this led to contributions on how to name groups and information needed in the explainable AI feature, we believe that future work in explainable AI should focus on who the AI is being explained to in terms of the output or explanations generated 

In a Spring 2023 classroom implementation of the curriculum and dashboard with a pair of 6th-grade teachers at the same school, the teachers reviewed the feedback from the classes as a pair after school so that they could work together to plan the class day 

The teachers identified that the majority of students struggled on the unplugged Rule Creation activity and that after the second day of computational modeling, approximately one-third of the students in 6 classes were unable to accurately implement one of the conditional statements 

The teachers created a new activity for the students in classes that struggled to construct the conditional statements: students were grouped and were tasked with developing a video to teach a 5th grade student to construct the computational model, referencing their Rule Creation task and the science experiments they completed previously";"Builds on existing methods: “● prompted teachers by asking, “If you were granted superpowers to better understand student learning and the successes and difficulties they experience during their learning, what superpowers would you like to possess?"",. ● provided initial “superpower"" cards leveraging results from past work (Holstein et al, 2019) to initiate discussions, and.”";Confirms observations from previous studies: “we identified the importance of simulating pedagogical decision making to support a deeper understanding of what makes feedback actionable to classroom teachers”;Contrasts other reports from prior research: “contrasting cases (to promote strong reactions by participating teachers, see Matuk et al, 2016).

However, there is a current deficiency in students’ AI literacy. In response to this challenge, this article introduced the AI STEM Project Design Framework (AI-STEM PDF) designed specifically for teaching AI in middle schools. The framework, created in adherence to Activity Theory and the principles of STEM environment design, consists of five layers: subject-object analysis layer, project design layer, learning tool layer, project rules layer, and project goals layer. Following the development of the AI-STEM PDF, AI-STEM projects were devised, and a pre-post experimental design study was conducted with 64 middle school students across two schools. The results revealed significant improvements in students’ AI literacy, thus affirming the value of the AI-STEM framework.

For teachers, how to skillfully apply AI in teaching and improve their AI literacy has become a necessary goal for their sustainable professional development. This research examines the correlations among the dimensions of AI literacy of teachers in order to promote the effectiveness of class teaching and the adoption of artificial intelligence literacy (AIL). Our findings are based on the analysis of 1013 survey results, where we tested the level of AI literacy of teachers, including Knowing and Understanding AI (KUAI), Applying AI (AAI), Evaluating AI Application (EAIA), and AI Ethics (AIE). We find that AAI had a significant, positive effect on the other three dimensions. Thus, based on the analysis, the government should take action to cultivate teachers’ AI literacy.

journal-article;Development of a Home Economics Education Program for the Consumer Life Area to Enhance Artificial Intelligence Literacy in Middle School Students;"You Jin Jung; Kyung Won Lee";Human Ecology Research;2024;10.6115/her.2024.036;This study aims to develop and validate a home economics education program focused on the consumer life area to enhance artificial intelligence (AI) literacy. To achieve this objective, a 10-session AI-consumer life integration education program was developed by analyzing literature on AI Literacy, AI curriculum, consumer education, and the home economics curriculum for the middle school consumer life area. The program’s validity was assessed by nine teachers using a four-point Likert scale. The average scores for each item and the content validity index (CVI) were calculated. Based on expert feedback, the program was revised and improved accordingly. The expert validity assessment of the lesson plans, teaching materials and learning resources resulted in an average score of 3.78 for all items and an average CVI of 0.96. For the overall program, the expert validity assessment yielded an average score of 3.72 for all items and an average CVI of 0.97. Since the content validity index for all questions was above 0.78, the program demonstrated high validity across achievement standards integration, learning objectives, content and teaching methods, motivation, and volume areas.

journal-article;"Education in &amp; with Robotics to Foster 21st-Century Skills";"Monica Malvezzi; Dimitris Alimisis; Michele Moro";Studies in computational intelligence;2021;10.1007/978-3-030-77022-8;Problem-solving is considered as one of the key competencies for the 21st century learners. In recent years, Educational Robotics (ER) proved to be a powerful tool to promote both computational thinking and problem-solving ability. However, research is still lacking in pathways to integrate ER into lower education curricula in order to use it as a real ‘cognitive artifact’. Furthermore, ER and coding are often introduced at school through short-term extra-curricular activities. This research paper reports on an extended path on both coding and ER, involving an Italian fourth-grade class which was fully integrated into the class curriculum. The contribution is thus aimed at analyzing the effects of ER integration on problem-solving skills development, focusing on three main components of this ability (reported on Lucangeli’s SPM test): comprehension, representation, and categorization. Multiple comparisons analysis was carried out using Friedman and Nemenyi post-hoc tests. The results show an improvement in students’ problemsolving skills. The strong points outlined in this path are its interdisciplinary and multimodal approach. The various activities proposed led students to regularly argue, negotiate, and collaborate, working on multiple domains of knowledge and with different kinds of tools. Moreover, the design of the path enhances the alternation of some binomials: theory-practice, frontal lesson-cooperative learning, and analog-digital dimension.;Computational Thinking;robotics;STEM;artificial intelligence;Educational robotics;Fair;"10 elementary school students; acknowledges limitations; provides data.

While teaching robotics with EDucational MOdular (EDMO) setups during the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that students embrace the opportunity to have their own hardware setups and to use these setups for independent problem solving 

No intended learning outcomes had to be dropped and the level of difficulty of examinations remained at the same high standards we achieved before COVID-19 

We envision that some concepts developed and tested due to COVID-19 restrictions will even be maintained after the pandemic 

In the future we envision to maintain video lectures for core and background material as well as instructional videos for tutorials and lab assignments as they allow students to study at their own pace and as staff gets to concentrate on activities to better support and challenge students, meeting their individual capabilities and needs

The results, along with the data collected from the observations showed the students’ perceptions and the limitations of this approach, such as the need of equipment, the technical issues that may appear, the limited collaboration between the students, the lack of physical interaction and the difficulty in monitoring where each student is during the lesson so that no one falls behind 

This study was the first stage of our research, pointing out the improvements that could be made in order the system to be more effective and easier to use";The aim of this paper is to explore robots as part of teaching assistant nurses on how to use robots in care work and to reflect upon how to contribute to relevant design. The paper explores what kind of questions should be included in a future curriculum on digitalization for assistant nurses and what difference it makes to participate in the design of robots to be used in care work. The approach is thus, what has been defined as a “theme-based curriculum approach” where the use of robots in home care work is the special topic for learning [6]. For KTH, this was a generic process in which robots were assigned a wider range of uses than the scenarios imagined in laboratories.Educating future healthcare professionals faces several challenges, in Sweden as well as on a global scale: new knowledge (i.e. epidemiology), new technology, i.e. digitalization demanding new ways of working and a better knowledge of citizens demands and needs [19]. There are also high expectations of what digitalization can achieve in care for the elderly. Ever since the first Information technology (IT) visions were launched in a global and European context, older people have been identified as those who had the most to gain from this development [21] followed by national IT strategies, commissions and research funding. In the Swedish government’s strategy for Life science and health, welfare technology is highlighted as one of the spearheads of digitalization, which, through participation from the elderly, and other citizens in need of help, will lead to increased independence and better health [22]. The general argument for these initiatives has been to meet the growing needs of a growing elderly population. Against this background, the first objective was to examine teachers’ expectations, and in doing so in comparison with policies published, with the ambition to increase the quality of care for the elderly with technology.;"SPM test

The naive conceptions of AI in K-12 contexts need to be identified since this hinders the clear understanding of AI concepts for young students 

The major research findings centered on what naive conceptions middle school students have toward AI and how those naive conceptions were transformed through the learning interventions 

By analyzing students’ actual interactions and the learning artifacts they created during the summer camp, the researchers could catch students’ naive conceptions of AI and track the transformation of their cognitive structures based on their performance 

The findings will advance our knowledge about common naive conceptions of middle-schoolers on AI so that teachers and educators can design their interventions based on the empirical foundations, in K-12 settings 

Some of the students’ naive conceptions were in line with previous studies such as perceiving AI as robotics, or AI as created to be smart (e.g., Kreinsen &amp; Schulz, 2021; Mertala et al, 2022; Ottenbreit-Leftwich et al, 2022; Szczuka et al, 2022; Zhang et al, 2022) 

As the teaching and learning strategies have been suggested to address the naive conceptions in several disciplines (Benson et al, 1993; Ginat et al, 2013; National Research Council, 1997; Porter et al, 2013), this study rendered the meaningful outcomes that those strategies could be extended to the context of teaching and learning AI concepts for young students 

By constantly asking questions to challenge their naive conceptions, collaborative hands-on experiences on creating learning artifacts, explaining the reasons why they use those AI concepts, and modifying through the feedback from others working in a good way that their naive conceptions gradually changed into more scientific concepts 

The findings revealed 6 naive conceptions about AI concepts: (1) AI was the same as automation and robotics; (2) AI was a cure-all solution; (3) AI was created to be smart; (4) All data can be used by AI; and (5) AI had nothing to do with ethical considerations 

It is consistent with the findings from the studies that students’ naive conceptions could be modified based on the learning interventions that were designed in age-appropriate hands-on practices, discussion, and participation of students (e.g., Basili &amp; Sanford, 1991; Hake, 1992; McCauley et al, 2008; Simon et al, 2010; Teague &amp; Lister, 2014)";This study aims to explore the middle schoolers’ common naive conceptions of AI and the evolution of these conceptions during an AI summer camp;The participants were recruited from public middle schools in the midwestern United States. The summer camp was promoted through social media, and a brief introduction of the program and the target group of participants was provided. A link to the registration site was provided so that those who were interested could register for the program. Consequently, a total of 14 students (twelve boys, and two girls) volunteered to participate in the week-long summer camp to learn about AI concepts and principles. Most of them were interested in CS or STEM education. All had prior experience participating in other summer camps to learn programming with a visual block-based programming language Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/) and/or participating in projects with science or STEM contexts.;"In‐depth understanding of students’ naive conceptions of AI Based on analyzing the videos and the learning artifacts, the researchers identified five main themes which revealed the middle school students’ common naive conceptions of AI: AI was the same as automation, AI was a cure-all solution, AI was created to be smart, All data can be used by AI, AI was impartial and fair, and AI had nothing to do with ethical considerations

journal-article;Higher education students’ perceptions of ChatGPT: A global study of early reactions;"Dejan Ravšelj; Damijana Keržič; Nina Tomaževič et al.";PLoS ONE;2025;10.1371/journal.pone.0315011;The paper presents the most comprehensive and large-scale global study to date on how higher education students perceived the use of ChatGPT in early 2024. With a sample of 23,218 students from 109 countries and territories, the study reveals that students primarily used ChatGPT for brainstorming, summarizing texts, and finding research articles, with a few using it for professional and creative writing. They found it useful for simplifying complex information and summarizing content, but less reliable for providing information and supporting classroom learning, though some considered its information clearer than that from peers and teachers. Moreover, students agreed on the need for AI regulations at all levels due to concerns about ChatGPT promoting cheating, plagiarism, and social isolation. However, they believed ChatGPT could potentially enhance their access to knowledge and improve their learning experience, study efficiency, and chances of achieving good grades. While ChatGPT was perceived as effective in potentially improving AI literacy, digital communication, and content creation skills, it was less useful for interpersonal communication, decision-making, numeracy, native language proficiency, and the development of critical thinking skills. Students also felt that ChatGPT would boost demand for AI-related skills and facilitate remote work without significantly impacting unemployment. Emotionally, students mostly felt positive using ChatGPT, with curiosity and calmness being the most common emotions. Further examinations reveal variations in students' perceptions across different socio-demographic and geographic factors, with key factors influencing students' use of ChatGPT also being identified. Higher education institutions' managers and teachers may benefit from these findings while formulating the curricula and instructions/regulations for ChatGPT use, as well as when designing the teaching methods and assessment tools. Moreover, policymakers may also consider the findings when formulating strategies for secondary and higher education system development, especially in light of changing labor market needs and related digital skills development.;natural language processing;creative writing;research article;logistic regression;self-regulated learning;Fair;"23218 students; acknowledges limitations; provides data.";The global study reveals how higher education students perceive ChatGPT in its early stages;"We can summarize that the tasks for which students used ChatGPT, supported by 25% or more of the students regardless of income region, were generating new ideas, summarizing long texts concisely, and helping with research writing 

Most students also agreed that ChatGPT could increase their study efficiency (59%), enhance their learning experience (58%), improve their ability to meet assignment deadlines, improve the quality of their assignments, and facilitate completing their studies, as emphasized by 57% of students 

On the other hand, less than 40% of students in all disciplines thought that ChatGPT could help them complete their internships or improve their employability 

More than 50% of students agreed that ChatGPT has the potential to improve their AI literacy, digital communication, and digital content creation skills (Fig 18) 

Less than 40% of students agreed that ChatGPT has the potential to improve interpersonal communication, decision-making skills, numeracy, native language proficiency, and critical thinking skills 

Applied sciences students viewed ChatGPT most positively, citing benefits like facilitating remote work (61%), requiring new skills (60%), changing job nature (60%), improving productivity (59%), and reducing workload (58%), but they were less positive about reducing inequality (44%), resolving skills gaps (42%), and addressing skills shortages (37%) 

Social sciences students were positive about increased demand for AI-related skills (61%) and reduced skills shortages (37%) but concerned about increased inequality (49%) and job reduction (39%) 

They saw improved productivity (53%) as a moderate benefit 

Arts and humanities students were optimistic about ChatGPT creating new jobs (53%), improving innovation (52%), and connecting education to the labor market (44%), but skeptical about reducing the workload (55%), resolving skill obsolescence (36%), and reducing underskilling (35%) 

Natural and life sciences students were generally negative, with fewer seeing benefits like job creation (46%) and innovation improvement (48%) 

The smallest perception gap was between applied sciences and natural and life sciences students (0.06), with over 40% using ChatGPT across fields 

Believed that ChatGPT would require employees to acquire new skills, while students in the upper middle income regions were facilitating remote work (61%), but students from the low income regions most frequently declared that ChatGPT reduces employee workload (64%) 

The proportional odds assumption was tested using the test of parallel lines, which was significant (p &lt; 0.001) for all three estimated ordinal logistic regression models, indicating that the regression slopes differ significantly across the levels of the dependent variable for all models [147] 

Specifically, the ability to simplify complex information consistently showed significant positive effects on the frequency of using ChatGPT across all three use cases, while the ability to summarize extensive information had a significant positive impact on two of the use cases. Both factors had the most substantial impact on the frequency of using ChatGPT for summarizing (β = 0.220; p &lt; 0.001 and β = 0.402; p &lt; 0.001, respectively) 

The potential of ChatGPT to enhance access to sources of knowledge appeared to have a negative and statistically significant impact on using ChatGPT for summarizing (β = -0.057; p &lt; 0.05), while it had a positive and statistically significant impact on academic writing (β = 0.108; p &lt; 0.001) 

The potential of ChatGPT to improve general knowledge had a positive and significant effect on the frequency of using ChatGPT across all three use cases, with the highest impact observed in brainstorming (β = 0.124; p &lt; 0.001) 

Students’ belief that they should take appropriate measures to protect personal information had a negative and statistically significant impact on the frequency of using ChatGPT across all three use cases, with the strongest negative impact observed in academic writing (β = -0.222; p &lt; 0.001) 

The first instance was the impact of ChatGPT’s perceived ability to enhance AI literacy skills, which was associated with an increased frequency of using ChatGPT for academic writing (β = 0.136; p &lt; 0.001) 

The second instance was the impact of ChatGPT’s perceived ability to enhance digital content creation skills, which was associated with an increased frequency of using ChatGPT for brainstorming (β = 0.130; p &lt; 0.001) 

On the other hand, the least prominent effects were observed for ChatGPT’s perceived ability to enhance AI skills on the use of ChatGPT for brainstorming (β = 0.079; p &lt; 0.001) and its perceived ability to enhance digital content creation skills on academic writing (β = 0.089; p &lt; 0.001) 

Students who felt curious and calm while interacting with ChatGPT tended to use it more frequently, with curiosity having the highest observed effect on the use of ChatGPT for brainstorming (β = 0.107; p &lt; 0.001), while its impact on other use cases was less pronounced 

Despite including participants from over 100 countries and/or territories, less than 1% came from low income countries";"Students most frequently reported using ChatGPT for brainstorming, with almost 30% (2.76), followed by using ChatGPT for summarizing long texts, which was supported by 27% of students (2.64), finding articles for research, supported by 25% of students (2.63), and writing texts, chosen by 22% of students (2.64), which is partially consistent with Chan and Hu’s [30] findings 

This discrepancy implies that while students appreciate the strengths of ChatGPT in making information easier to understand and summarizing content, they remain skeptical about its reliability and usefulness in a traditional classroom setting 

Arts and humanities students (53%), who prioritize nuanced and interpretive language, might be more critical of ChatGPT’s ability to capture the depth and subtleties of human expression. This indicates that while ChatGPT is valued for its technical prowess in certain disciplines, its perceived shortcomings in handling more abstract and subjective content limit its acceptance among students in fields that demand such capabilities 

This could be due to the greater reliance of students from low income regions on cost-effective digital tools to Higher education students’ perceptions of ChatGPT: A global study of early reactions supplement their lack of educational resources [109] 

There were fears that these systems might compromise the ethics of study and Higher education students’ perceptions of ChatGPT: A global study of early reactions mislead users with inaccurate information 

Students from arts and humanities showed the strongest inclination toward regulatory support across all settings, in the belief that ChatGPT should be subject to university and faculty ethical guidelines (57%) 

Only 25% of students agreed or strongly agreed that it is easier to interact with ChatGPT than with colleagues and that the information obtained from ChatGPT is clearer than that provided by their teachers

Second, to verify the program’s effectiveness, the study clarified the definition of AI and AI education and considered their meaning in technology education. This study used three steps: preparation, development, and improvement. In the preparation step, this study set the theme and purpose of the AI program and selected the free semester activity type “theme selection activity.” After analyzing the technology curriculum and extracting AI-related elements in the development step, this study laid out the program for 16 h of class time. In the improvement step, to augment the program’s validity, the researcher revised and supplemented it as a whole through expert consultation. This research differentiated the developed program from the AI education program of other subjects and specialized it, focusing on the specificity of technology education. The study emphasized the social impact of the latest technology, ethics of AI, physical computing using AI, and technological problem-solving activity using AI. The final developed program was applied to the students, and students participated in a pretest and posttest. The study used the PATT and AI competency test tools. The PATT results showed a significant increase in the mean of both constructs in “interest in technology” and “career aspirations in technology.” In AI competency, the mean of two constructs increased significantly in “social impact of AI” and “AI performance.” In particular, “AI performance” showed the largest increase. There was no statistically significant change in “interaction with AI.” The study results confirmed that the developed AI program was effective in technology education and career exploration, which is the primary purpose of the free semester. In addition, it was possible to confirm the technology educational value of the AI education program centered on technological problem-solving.

Under the “Middle School Free Semester Implementation Plan,” the free semester started nationwide in 2016. From 2020, the free semester expanded to the free year system (Ministry of Education, 2015a). The free semester is a flexible curriculum that improves student-participatory classes so that students can discover their dreams and talents, enabling a variety of career-related experiential activities. However, because the in-service teachers need to spend more time on research and have an increased workload due to the new teaching and evaluation methods, they avoid taking charge of the free semester (Shin et al, 2015).";"The study results confirmed that the developed AI program was effective in technology education and career exploration, which is the primary purpose of the free semester

journal-article;Integrating Ethics and Career Futures with Technical Learning to Promote AI Literacy for Middle School Students: An Exploratory Study;"Helen Zhang; Irene Lee; Safinah Ali et al.";International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;2022;10.1007/s40593-022-00293-3;The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) necessitates promoting AI education at the K-12 level. However, educating young learners to become AI literate citizens poses several challenges. The components of AI literacy are ill-defined and it is unclear to what extent middle school students can engage in learning about AI as a sociotechnical system with socio-political implications. In this paper we posit that students must learn three core domains of AI: technical concepts and processes, ethical and societal implications, and career futures in the AI era. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) workshop that aimed to integrate middle school students’ learning of the three domains. We found that after the workshop, most students developed a general understanding of AI concepts and processes (e.g., supervised learning and logic systems). More importantly, they were able to identify bias, describe ways to mitigate bias in machine learning, and start to consider how AI may impact their future lives and careers. At exit, nearly half of the students explained AI as not just a technical subject, but one that has personal, career, and societal implications. Overall, this finding suggests that the approach of incorporating ethics and career futures into AI education is age appropriate and effective for developing AI literacy among middle school students. This study contributes to the field of AI Education by presenting a model of integrating ethics into the teaching of AI that is appropriate for middle school students.;machine learning;middle school student;neural networks;curricula;artificial intelligence;Fair;"25 middle school students; large effect size; acknowledges limitations; provides data.

The rise of AI has attracted many researchers’ attention and led to calls for creating opportunities to engage young learners in AI education. While the content and pedagogy of AI education at the K-12 level have not been established, recent review studies (Marques et al, 2020; Zhou et al, 2020) pointed out a dearth of AI curriculum and programs that incorporate AI ethics, a topic that is critical to prepare young students to become informed users and developers of AI technology. This paper aims to help fill in this gap by reporting the design and implementation of the DAILy curriculum that interweaves student learning of the technical, ethical or societal, and career aspects of AI. Our results demonstrate that the DAILy workshop was engaging and productive in supporting student learning of general concepts of AI concepts, logic systems, and machine learning. Students enjoyed ethics-related activities embedded in the DAILy curriculum. They were able to internalize what they had experienced, connected to ethical implications of technology design, and developed positive ideas about their future selves with AI after the workshop. Overall, the approach of combining ethics and technical learning of AI is age appropriate and promising in terms of developing AI literacy among middle schoolers. Our work also contributes to the AI education field by providing a working definition of AI literacy grounded in findings of what middle school students are capable of learning and doing with AI.";I mean the journalists.”), and accomplish tasks more efficiently (“A great consequence about it, about AI is that we can shorten, or we can expedite a bunch of jobs or tasks that we do everyday that we can do over 50% faster.”);"Many K-12 students, those underrepresented in STEM/Computing, may feel unprepared and not be able to persist and succeed in completing these courses. In their systematic mapping study, noted that many curricula teaching Machine Learning at the K-12 level employed the interactive approach where students are exposed to AI concepts through interactions with AI tools as an end-user followed with some degree of knowledge building and reasoning about how AI works 

The Developing AI Literacy” (DAILy) curriculum is organized by a hierarchy of key technical concepts that have been suggested age appropriate based on our previous work (Ali et al, 2019), including (1) an Introduction to AI, (2) Logic Systems, (3) Machine Learning, (4) Supervised learning and (5) Unsupervised learning 

In the “General” category, students often referred to human intelligence and explained that AI is different from human intelligence 

To explore what kinds of ideas students developed about AI’s ethical and societal implications through the DAILy workshop, we examined the interviews conducted with the 19 students after the workshop

The emphasis on AI’s ethical and societal implications offers an effective way to excite underrepresented students, which resonates with previous research that minority students are often more drawn to STEM/CS programs that teaches the content via the context of solving social justice issues (Mark et al, 2013; Vakil, 2018)";This paper aims to help fill in this gap by reporting the design and implementation of the DAILy curriculum that interweaves student learning of the technical, ethical or societal, and career aspects of AI;"semi-structured interviews

In Module 1, we plan to add more concrete examples of prediction in AI and engage students in discussions or debates on whether and why technologies make predictions or not.

journal-article;Junior High School Artificial Intelligence Literacy: Connotation, Evaluation and Promotion Strategy;"Xinyu Wang; LI Xiao-mei; Jianyong Huang";Open Journal of Social Sciences;2023;10.4236/jss.2023.115004;In the junior middle school of compulsory education in China, artificial intelligence courses are being rapidly promoted to help students form artificial intelligence literacy. Then, how to define the connotation of junior high school students' artificial intelligence literacy, build a literacy evaluation framework, and provide decision support for students' information literacy level improvement is an urgent topic to be studied at present. Based on this, this study deeply analyzes the development context and connotation of artificial intelligence literacy and information literacy, and defines the connotation of literacy with emphasis on the uniqueness and independence of artificial intelligence literacy. Based on this, we design the evaluation framework of artificial intelligence literacy in junior high schools, and evaluate the artificial intelligence literacy level of junior high school students in Qingdao Artificial Intelligence Education Experimental Zone, China. The evaluation results show that the overall level of students' artificial intelligence literacy is high, but the development in four dimensions is uneven. There are significant differences in artificial intelligence literacy among junior middle school students with different gender, grade, class frequency, task cooperation frequency, learning value and goal, and self-efficacy. Finally, according to the evaluation results, this study puts forward the corresponding strategies to improve the quality of artificial intelligence.;Artificial Intelligence Literacy;information literacy;middle school;High School;junior high school student;;;In terms of class frequency, this study found that the class frequency of one week is the best for improving the artificial intelligence literacy of junior high school students in Qingdao artificial intelligence experimental area;"In four first-level dimensions, the level of artificial intelligence awareness and intelligent social responsibility dimension of junior two students is significantly lower than that of junior one and junior three students, and there is no significant difference between junior one and junior three students 

The application level of intelligent technology and the level of practical innovative thinking in grade three are significantly lower than those in grade one and grade two, and there is no significant difference between grade one and grade two 

In terms of grade, the artificial intelligence literacy of grade one is significantly higher than that of grade two and grade three, but there is no significant difference between grade two and grade three";"It is found that the scoring rates of the four first-level indicators are all above 60%, which indicates that junior high school students have a certain level of artificial intelligence literacy 

In order to deeply analyze the current situation of junior high school students’ artificial intelligence literacy, independent sample T test and one-way ANOVA are used to test the differences of junior high school students’ artificial intelligence literacy with different characteristics 

There are significant differences between junior middle school students’ artificial intelligence literacy level and each dimension in self-efficacy, critical thinking and learning value and goal level, and the artificial intelligence literacy has improved with the improvement of all aspects 

The research results show that the overall level of junior high school artificial intelligence literacy in Qingdao Artificial Intelligence Education Experimental Zone is at a high level, but there are certain differences in four dimensions, among which the development level of intelligent social responsibility is the highest, followed by artificial intelligence consciousness, practical and innovative thinking is relatively weak, and the application score of intelligent technology is the lowest 

The difference is that Zhu et al put innovation and application literacy in the same dimension when they divide the information literacy dimension of junior high school students, and the result is that girls are significantly higher than boys, which should be related to the different emphasis on students’ requirements of information literacy and artificial intelligence literacy 

In terms of class frequency, this study found that the class frequency of one week is the best for improving the artificial intelligence literacy of junior high school students in Qingdao artificial intelligence experimental area 

In terms of task cooperation frequency, the research results show that a higher level of task cooperation frequency will significantly promote the improvement of junior high school students’ artificial intelligence literacy level 

In terms of self-efficacy, this study found that junior high school students’ artificial intelligence literacy is positively correlated with their self-efficacy level 

In four first-level dimensions, the level of artificial intelligence awareness and intelligent social responsibility dimension of junior two students is significantly lower than that of junior one and junior three students, and there is no significant difference between junior one and junior three students 

Combined with the analysis of the existing research and data, this study clarifies the connotation of junior high school artificial intelligence literacy: the comprehensive performance of students’ knowledge, skills, processes, methods, emotional attitudes and values about artificial intelligence gradually formed in the process of receiving artificial intelligence education";The purpose of this study is to build a comprehensive, scientific and effective evaluation framework for junior high school students’ artificial intelligence literacy, so as to accurately, objectively and comprehensively evaluate students’ artificial intelligence literacy level and provide decision support for improving students’ information literacy level;"questionnaire

Here, we propose the concept of AI literacy and develop a quantitative scale for obtaining accurate data regarding the AI literacy of ordinary users. We first identified the primary core constructs of AI literacy, including awareness, use, evaluation, and ethics. Next, we generated 65 items to capture these four constructs; only 31 items were retained after a three-step content validation process. Then, we conducted a survey, and collected two samples of data. By reducing the number of items using the first sample and performing reliability and validity tests on the second sample, we obtained a 12-item instrument for the quantitative measurement of AI literacy.

journal-article;Reflections on the past two decades of Mind, Brain, and Education;"Ola Ozernov‐Palchik; Courtney Pollack; Elizabeth Bonawitz et al.";Mind Brain and Education;2024;10.1111/mbe.12407;"In the early 2000s, Kurt Fischer and colleagues founded the Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) field (Blake &amp; Gardner, 2007; Fischer &amp; Bidell, 2006), including a flagship journal, society (International Mind, Brain, Education Society [IMBES]), and a master's degree program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (Harvard). The MBE program was the first-of-its-kind, focused on the intersection of neurobiology, psychology, and educational research and practice (Blake &amp; Gardner, 2007; Fischer, 2009). Between its first cohort in 2004 and its final cohort in 2022, the program graduated 668 students from around the world (see Figure 1). Contemporaneously, scholars developed MBE or related Educational Neuroscience initiatives in several US states, Canada, the United Kingdom, Austria, The Netherlands, China, Israel, across Latin America, and other locations around the world. A central question in education revolves around what instructional approaches work for whom and under which conditions. MBE seeks to address these inquiries by leveraging cross-disciplinary methods and frameworks with rigorous scientific precision. Yet, the progression of scientific knowledge is often limited by the tools at hand. Herein lies one of the most significant contributions of MBE: It acts as a catalyst for methodological innovation, highlighting the limitations of current scientific approaches in tackling some of the most pressing educational challenges. The need to model the complex probabilistic relations that underlie educational response propelled innovation in the application of sophisticated computational techniques to highly dimensional student data. To illustrate, in a recent study, we used machine learning (ML) to improve methods of prediction of instructional responses in first-grade students at risk for reading disabilities (Shangguan et al., 2023; Zhongkai et al., Under Review). Due to challenges such as incomplete data from young participants, our initial ML models struggled to forecast student outcomes accurately. It wasn't until we integrated methods adapted from the fields of natural language processing and computer vision that we saw a significant uptick in accuracy. We trained our models to recognize hidden patterns between known and unknown data points, resulting in an enhanced out-of-sample prediction accuracy of 80%. In another example, innovative ML was applied to video recordings of math lessons to identify what teacher discourse features were important for supporting a positive learning mindset in students (Hunkins, Kelly, &amp; D'Mello, 2022). In a different domain, the need for more ecologically valid neuroimaging to measure how cognitive and neural processes that underlie learning unfold in naturalistic settings, has facilitated the optimization of portable neuroimaging methods across a diverse range of contexts. For example, portable electroencephalography has been used to study student engagement during live classroom instruction (Davidesco, Matuk, Bevilacqua, Poeppel, &amp; Dikker, 2021; Landi et al., 2019), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy has been used to document neural signatures of reading development in children growing in environments with a high risk of illiteracy, rural Côte d'Ivoire (Jasińska &amp; Guei, 2018). The implementation of portable neuroimaging in these settings posed methodological challenges, and the response to those challenges fostered innovation. In-school EEG data collection is noisy, so the team has leveraged high-density EEG tools, which capture thousands of data points per second, combined with ML classifiers, to dissociate signal from noise. This allowed for a more precise characterization of individual differences in the neural substrates of reading as they unfold during instruction (Davidesco et al., 2021; Landi et al., 2019). To address the challenges of setting up a portable neuroimaging laboratory in low-resource contexts, researchers developed comprehensive protocols addressing problems such as high humidity and lack of Internet access (Jasińska &amp; Guei, 2018). The advancement of these portable neuroimaging methods and the emergence of additional technologies, such as portable magnetic resonance imaging, can enable more equitable access to neuroimaging technologies around the world. Over the past 20 years, the MBE field has facilitated the expansion of empirical, translational, and policy-relevant work through a breadth of opportunities to bridge the mind, brain, and education sciences. Using mostly lab-based cognitive neuroscience approaches (but see Janssen et al., 2021), educational neuroscience researchers have examined the cognitive and neural bases of school-relevant skills. Not meant to impact the classroom directly, this research has elucidated the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie learning, such as basic processes in numerical cognition (Pollack &amp; Price, 2019, 2020), the relation between math and reading (Pollack et al., 2021; Pollack &amp; Ashby, 2018), and the connection of both with executive functioning (Marks et al., 2023). Connecting to classroom learning, MBE work has advanced understandings of education challenges across levels of analysis. For example, MBE work has evidenced the deleterious biological and psychological effects of racial/ethnic discrimination and how they undermine student performance and opportunities to thrive (Levy, Heissel, Richeson, &amp; Adam, 2016; Shonkoff, Slopen, &amp; Williams, 2021), and translated research for myriad education stakeholders (The Learning Scientists, 2023; https://bold.expert/). MBE's interdisciplinary approach has also informed policy. A synthesis of convergent evidence from biology, psychology, and education shows that adolescents benefit from starting school later (Watson et al., 2017), which provided strong evidence for California's 2022 implementation of later middle and high school start times (SB-328 Pupil Attendance: School Start Time, 2019). Alongside the expansion of MBE research, additional training and career development opportunities support the field's expansion, including the 2017 establishment of the IMBES Trainee Board by early career scholars (Gotlieb et al., 2019). The international proliferation of programs and centers (e.g., University of Alabama, Vanderbilt University, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, University of Graz, East China Normal University, University College London) has made joining the community easier. I am particularly enthusiastic about the field's potential moving forward. MBE stakeholders can expand research-practice partnership opportunities, emphasize learning from educational practice, and further increase access and representation in the questions we ask and who may answer them. Educators have long been aware of a simple fact: sparking a child's curiosity will help them learn (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1981). Developmental psychologists have suggested that children's insatiable wonder is a critical drive in cognition that supports intuitive theory building and scientific reasoning (Gopnik, 2016; Keil, 2022; Schulz, 2012). Robotics, ML, and artificial general intelligence researchers have begun to build models with ""curiosity"" rewards to bootstrap learning (see Haber, 2022 for recent review). Psychological and computational theories link it to our need to resolve uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps (Gottlieb, Oudeyer, Lopes, &amp; Baranes, 2013; Loewenstein, 1994). But until recently, formalizing exactly what curiosity is and how it relates directly to learning and the brain has remained less well understood (Kidd &amp; Hayden, 2015). One of the most exciting developments in MBE has been new brain measures that might ""tap into"" and even provide explanation for the function and mechanisms underlying our drive to resolve uncertainty. In particular, EEG studies (measuring the electrical signals in the brain) have revealed several important connections between the theta oscillation brain signal and behavior: theta oscillations are involved in memory formation and reward; they are predictive of learning success; and, even in infancy, they are heightened preceding events that are predicted to reveal new information (see Begus &amp; Bonawitz, 2020 for review). Such measures allow us to decouple previously confounded measures of curiosity and learning, such as the child's exploration (which can be influenced by factors beyond curiosity) and information gathered (which affects the inferences that can be drawn). We can then also understand how the child's current beliefs and preceding experiences (e.g., established knowledge, goals, and rapport with a teacher, see Bonawitz &amp; Shafto, 2016) affect a learner's expectation of information and curiosity. And we can study more precisely how brain measures that might reflect curiosity then relate to attention, memory, and learning. Such explanatory models will allow us to understand better how to support curiosity in all learners. It is a very exciting time, as we are just at the precipice of building causal, theory-driven models of the role of curiosity in the mind and brain for education. Since the early 2000s, the field of MBE has continued to provide novel insights and perspectives across research-practice-clinic settings. The power of this research has been showcased in how we conceptualize learning differences, reading acquisition, and brain plasticity. With a focus on learning disabilities or difficulties, I draw on the example of dyslexia, a common reading disability that impacts the accuracy and/or fluency of single-word reading (Lyon et al., 2001; Lyon et al., 2003). One of the earliest contributions of cognitive neuroscience research was in establishing that dyslexia was indeed ""neurobiological in origin,"" in that brain signatures for reading differ between groups of readers with and without dyslexia. Although seemingly elemental, this insight continues to act as a framework essential in reframing attribution for the difficulties faced by struggling readers (i.e., it was not based on laziness, limited aptitude, etc. as many continue to believe; Cortiella &amp; Horowitz, 2014; Horowitz, Rawe, &amp; Whittaker, 2017). Furthermore, the accumulated evidence that the ""reading brain"" is plastic, and changes in ways specific to the reading programs used (Eden et al., 2004; Yoncheva, Wise, &amp; McCandliss, 2015), has redoubled the importance of providing evidence-based reading instruction to developing readers. MBE research has also converged with theories of learning (e.g., dynamic skills theory; Fischer &amp; Bidell, 2006) to reveal that skill acquisition is dynamic, with the impact of reading instruction differing by student and environmental characteristics, as well as by academic calendar phases (i.e., during summer vacation; Romeo et al., 2018; Meisler et al., 2023). Insights from studies on reading abilities among individuals with distinct neural architecture (e.g., relying on a single hemisphere as a consequence of epilepsy-related surgery) have likewise emphasized the resilience of students and the multiple pathways to reading progress (Christodoulou et al., 2021; Katzir, Christodoulou, &amp; DeBode, 2017). Across these types of contributions, MBE has advanced how we conceptualize learning and teaching. Looking ahead, MBE can harness the vast foundational knowledge now established to explore more complex and nuanced studies of children in contexts (e.g., examining the interactions of who a child is with what is being asked and in what context). Another potential for innovation is advancing toward MBE research that shifts away from group-based inquiries to individual differences models. Most importantly, MBE research will matter in the future when it is disseminated effectively, in a manner inclusive and representative of our populations of interest, and meaningful for the communities we serve as scientists. When the MBE field started to emerge, it had a number of bold ideas and hypotheses. For example, people were excited about the prospect of using neuroimaging to diagnose learning differences, characterize individual learning trajectories, or as a tool to identify who will subsequently struggle with learning to read or math. Furthermore, there was excitement about a direct translation of neuroimaging findings into the classroom using ""brain-based curricula."" Over the last 20 years, the field has learned a lot about neuroimaging methodology and its limitations and has also started to ask more refined questions and build relationships among the various stakeholders in the scientific and educational settings. As a result, evidence-based translational knowledge and scientifically trained changemakers have emerged (Solari et al., 2020; Ansari &amp; Coch, 2006; Sheridan &amp; McLaughlin, 2022; Thomas et al., 2019; Blakemore &amp; Bunge, 2012; Gabrieli, 2016). In my opinion, the most significant impact of MBE on educational practice is at least twofold. First, we now understand that the development of academic skills and their precursors starts as early as in utero. Therefore, we need to understand a child's entire developmental trajectory (both generally and in key skills such as language and reading) in the context of variable environments to determine how, when, and where brains learn best (Ozernov-Palchik, Yu, Wang, &amp; Gaab, 2016). Second, inspired by neuroscientific evidence that brain differences underlying disorders such as developmental dyslexia are present as early as infancy (Guttorm et al., 2005; Langer et al., 2017), the idea of ""preventative education"" is emerging, and early identification of children at risk for atypical developmental trajectories of academic skills is starting to get embraced (Fletcher et al., 2021; Gaab &amp; Petscher, 2022; Catts &amp; Petscher, 2022; Catts &amp; Hogan, 2021; Ozernov-Palchik et al., 2016). All but 11 states in the United States have passed legislation for universal kindergarten literacy screening designed to identify children at risk for literacy-based disabilities (https://improvingliteracy.org/state-of-dyslexia). Education needs to continue to move from a reactive model to a proactive model, similar to shifts that happened in other fields that led to impactful practices such as preventative medicine (e.g., mammograms for breast cancer detection, Duffy et al., 2020). The field of MBE began with great excitement as modern neuroimaging techniques allowed for visualization and measurement of the brain bases of learning, how that develops from infancy through adulthood, and how that varies in different kinds of learners. It was, and is, thrilling to view the functional and structural brain bases of learning, the essence of education. In broad terms, MBE embraced the idea that, where possible, understanding and improving educational outcomes needs to be fueled by scientific evidence. For centuries, the understanding of the brain bases of learning was informed only by the study of adults with focal brain injuries. Now a neuroscience perspective could be brought directly to children and their developing brains, and to many aspects of education and learning, from reading to math and to broader cognitive skills, like executive functions, and social-emotional functions that support all kinds of learning. A change over time is that neuroimaging research has broadened its perspective from a focus on specific learning differences to consider also differences related to environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status, that have such broad impacts on education outcomes and opportunities (Mackey et al., 2015). One significant contribution of MBE was that powerful evidence became available for the brain bases of learning differences, such as dyslexia. Diversity among children's brains can make various aspects of learning to read easier or harder. Indeed, such differences are now documented for risk for dyslexia from infancy (Yu et al., 2022) through the start of school (Saygin et al., 2013) and for dyslexia through the years of schooling into adulthood. Further, the identification of differences in pre-readers opened up opportunities for early support that prevent severe struggles. Neuroimaging also revealed brain plasticity associated with helpful educational practices, which further supported the importance of such practices. In some cases, neuroimaging outperformed typical education measures in predicting future improvement in reading among children with dyslexia (Hoeft et al., 2011). The idea that brain measures, in combination with typical education measures, could help identify which student is most likely to benefit from alternative supports opens the possibility of more effective individualized education. The MBE field has had a profound and positive impact on education for neurodiverse students and their families. A learning difference diagnosis can describe a student's challenges, but it can also be perceived as overly prescriptive, limiting the potential for a student's future academic success. Neuroimaging studies have revealed that children with learning differences recruit alternative pathways and develop compensatory strategies to achieve success in the domain in which they are impaired (Yu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2023). For students with diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or dyslexia, this idea that learning involves many concurrent processes is empowering: Even if a student faces some challenges, they can rely on other strengths and capabilities to find success. In my work as an educator, I have used the MBE approach as a tool for combating misleading claims about learning and the brain. As a music teacher, I have used my MBE background to help parents overcome misleading information about music and child development (like the so-called ""Mozart effect"") and instead provide more reliable insights about how early music exposure can help young children's developing speech and language (Tierney &amp; Kraus, 2013; Zhao &amp; Kuhl, 2016). With its focus on applying scientific evidence to inform educational practice, MBE helps educators to be more discerning consumers and effective stewards of information about learning and the brain. As an education funder for a global philanthropic organization, Porticus (2023), I have the privilege of learning from many nonprofit leaders, practitioners, public policymakers, and the like. From this bird's-eye view, I've witnessed a shifting interest in incorporating the learning and developmental sciences—the crux of MBE—into practice and policy. Perhaps the most revolutionizing contribution from MBE to the education sector has been an evidence-based understanding of the conditions required to support learning. Organizations like Turnaround for Children (https://turnaroundusa.org) convey the clear science that all children are born with brains that are ready to learn, that learning depends on conditions in the environment, and that we must design care and educational settings that enable children to thrive (Jensen et al., 2021; Troller-Renfree et al., 2022; Troller-Renfree et al., 2023). A sense of belonging, safe environment, supportive relationships, and a holistic approach to building student skills, mindsets, and autonomy are fundamental to learning (Caballero et al., 2019). The resources published by networks such as the Science of Learning and Development Alliance (2023) are critical to translating these scientific principles into actionable guides for implementation, like the Design Principles (Learning Policy Institute &amp; Turnaround for Children, 2021). What excites me most is seeing these tenets being implemented in pockets across the globe. NGOs have been thought leaders in bridging the knowledge-practice gap. For instance, in addition to Turnaround, Transcend Education (https://transcendeducation.org) uses a community-driven R&amp;D model to build school environments with evidence-based design and practices. These organizations and others are working with districts across the country, such as Washington DC Public Schools, to redesign systems with contextualized MBE principles embedded within their core operations. MBE has made a lasting contribution to education with the research-supported Universal Design for Learning framework (UDL; Rose &amp; Meyer, 2002). UDL emphasizes diverse populations; it offers actionable guidelines for enacting change and the optimal design of educational experiences for all. UDL has permeated education practice and policy (e.g., Higher Education Opportunity Act, 2008; Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 2004) and influenced the design and implementation of educational materials, including curricula for Artificial Intelligence (AI) education (Walsh et al., 2022). The AI for K-12 initiative (AI4K12) highlights considerations for AI technology in education, such as biases in data that AI models use for training, issues of equity in AI, and societal impacts (Touretzky, Gardner-McCune, Martin, &amp; Seehorn, 2019). In response, designers, researchers, and stakeholders use the UDL framework to make curricular materials accessible and engaging (Walsh &amp; Dalton, 2022). In codesigning learning activities for an inclusive AI literacy curriculum, Responsible AI for Computational Action (https://raise.mit.edu/research-projects/inclusive-ai-literacy-learning/), I witnessed special needs teachers on the research team and field-based teacher partners cite UDL in their curriculum modifications, for example, the UDL principle of multiple modes of expression. Teacher partners modified a module in which students redesign a space and incorporate AI technology in an all-digital format to allow students to build physical miniature models of their envisioned room, which would help students articulate their designs and thoughts. UDL's translation from the research base to practical, actionable guidelines can facilitate the wide adoption of brain-science-informed learning design decisions among educators. As MBE evolves, we should celebrate its progress and continue to expand its mainstream adoption through the translation of cutting-edge research into practical applications and frameworks. Such translation can facilitate practitioners' and designers' uptake of these advancements, ultimately enhancing the inclusivity and equity of educational programs. In the last few years, I have observed a growing interest among educators (in North America and beyond) seeking knowledge on child development through cognitive neuroscience, focusing on mechanisms underlying behavioral outcomes. From early childhood education to college learning, schools often become children and adolescents' ""second home"" where they spend an extended amount of time. Educators and schools are active agents in shaping not only children's learning outcomes, but also their development. I had the pleasure of working with several educators who actively contributed to informing and designing our experiments. Furthermore, many of the doctoral students I worked with at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) were teachers and educators, creating synergetic collaborations merging their professional experiences with research. Personally, as a researcher engaging in both cognitive neuroscience and education research relating to multilingualism, embracing the MBE approach has changed me to be a better learner and listener. By spending time talking to educators at the state-, district-, and school-levels as a cognitive neuroscience researcher of language, I learned about their challenges and achievements from practitioner and policymaking perspectives. By observing Head Start classrooms and interacting with parents and educators, I listened to their concerns and gained a grounded perspective on child development. These voices enriched the way my research is framed and designed. For example, the shift from viewing multilingualism as a homogeneous group in state-level data (Luk &amp; Kroll, 2019; Mancilla-Martinez, Oh, Luk, &amp; Rollins, 2022; Yamasaki &amp; Luk, 2018), and the shift to focus on outcomes to process and individual language experiences (Leon Guerrero, Whitford, Mesite, &amp; Luk, 2021; Luk, 2022; Smith, Leon Guerrero, Surrain, &amp; Luk, 2021) facilitate the understanding of learning mechanisms, which informs pedagogical strategies in linguistically diverse classrooms. I see the next stage of MBE being a two-way street, bringing researchers and stakeholders of education together, centering on child development and learning, and synergistically enriching scholarly knowledge, pedagogical practice, and educational policy. MBE-minded researchers, practitioners, and policymakers situated in different contexts aim to improve children's well-being by investing in MBE collaborations and synergy to transform cognitive neuroscience to be ecologically meaningful and relevant. Over the past two decades, I have witnessed an eagerness among educators to learn more about the brain and brain development and to explore how knowledge of brain development can inform the field of education. Embedded within this is a curiosity about how one studies human brain development and thus, an interest in learning more about the broad field of neuroimaging. In terms of what most excites me, several things come to mind. First, there have been major advances in our understanding of errors in brain development that lead to children struggling to learn to read (dyslexia; Norton, Beach, &amp; Gabrieli, 2015), to master mathematics (dyscalculia; De Smedt, Peters, &amp; Ghesquière, 2019), and to communicate socially (autism; Willsey &amp; State, 2015). These errors can be genetic (e.g., single gene disorders such as Rett Syndrome or Fragile X Syndrome) or environmental (e.g., children experiencing profound neglect early in life, such as those abandoned in orphanages McLaughlin, Sheridan, &amp; Nelson, 2017). For example, in one study, my colleagues and I demonstrated the causal effects of the caregiving environment on children's stress response during academic-like tasks (e.g., mental arithmetic; McLaughlin et al., 2015). Second, advances in neuroimaging have increasingly allowed us to identify children at risk for developmental disorders very early in life (e.g., work on the development of biomarkers that can be used as objective ""readouts"" of atypical development, before behavioral readouts become reliable). For example, across multiple studies, we found that atypicalities in brain function in infants can facilitate earlier identification of autism spectrum disorder (Bosl, Tager-Flusberg, &amp; Nelson, 2018; Peck et al., 2021). MBE as a field has evolved considerably, and there continues to be a lot to be excited about! There have been substantial advancements in mechanistic descriptions of typical and disordered development across domains such as reading, mathematics, creativity, and social communication. Furthermore, MBE research has generated complementary neurobiological evidence in support of educational policies and practices, such as preventative universal literacy screening and a later school start time, to optimize learning and healthy development across the life span. While MBE has achieved notable progress in its two-decade existence, it continues to strive to fulfill its foundational promise of enhancing precision in risk identification, outcome prediction, and individualized education (Gabrieli, 2016). In closing this paper, we distill the insights from the individual contributions into three main challenges hindering MBE's influence on educational practice and policy: (1) inter-individual heterogeneity, (2) limited generalizability, and (3) gaps in the implementation of scientific evidence. We include some hopeful developments for addressing these challenges. For neuroscience to advance education, it is critical to understand how the nervous system relates to behavior by examining the associations between measures of the brain and variation in some behavior. Measures of brain and behavior, however, are complex, with multiple factors that influence their reliability (Elliott et al., 2020, 2021; Noble, Scheinost, &amp; Constable, 2019; Zorowitz &amp; Niv, 2023). Consequently, brain-behavior associations yield very small effect sizes and require enormous sample sizes (in the thousands!) to detect these effects reliably (Marek et al., 2022). To address issues of optimizing sample sizes and increasing reliability, the field has been moving toward multi-lab collaborations, resulting in consortia with thousands of participants (e.g., Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study; Volkow et al., 2018) and in-depth multi-session characterization of individuals using precision neuroimaging approaches (Grotton et al., 2022). These approaches will enable a comprehensive understanding of how the brain is related to behavior. The application of research findings across populations is critical for the advancement of knowledge, and in turn for the application of findings to diverse communities. As evident in the examples highlighted in the current paper, most MBE studies to date have been conducted in non-naturalistic lab settings, under tightly controlled conditions, and on nonrepresentative WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic; Henrich et al., 2010) populations. There has been a shift toward increased focus on engaging and training diverse communities in research and transitioning research from labs to schools and communities. Such efforts are necessary to establish the boundaries of generalizability of findings and determine what is true for what populations. Finally, the adoption of evidence-based practices in education has been impeded, in part, by a paucity of knowledge regarding factors that affect their implementation and sustainability in educational settings. Currently, there is an intensified focus on pinpointing the components of specific programs, discerning the barriers and facilitators across various educational contexts, understanding the structural characteristics of the participating institutions, and evaluating the individual factors of those targeted and those implementing the program, crucial for successful implementation and sustainability. Drawing from this work, the field has increasingly emphasized engagement in equitable and sustainable research collaborations with educators.

MBE as a field has evolved considerably, and there continues to be a lot to be excited about! There have been substantial advancements in mechanistic descriptions of typical and disordered development across domains such as reading, mathematics, creativity, and social communication. Furthermore, MBE research has generated complementary neurobiological evidence in support of educational policies and practices, such as preventative universal literacy screening and a later school start time, to optimize learning and healthy development across the life span. While MBE has achieved notable progress in its two-decade existence, it continues to strive to fulfill its foundational promise of enhancing precision in risk identification, outcome prediction, and individualized education (Gabrieli, 2016). In closing this paper, we distill the insights from the individual contributions into three main challenges hindering MBE’s influence on educational practice and policy: (1) inter-individual heterogeneity, (2) limited generalizability, and (3) gaps in the implementation of scientific evidence. We include some hopeful developments for addressing these challenges.";We trained our models to recognize hidden patterns between known and unknown data points, resulting in an enhanced out-of-sample prediction accuracy of 80%;"EEG studies have revealed several important connections between the theta oscillation brain signal and behavior: theta oscillations are involved in memory formation and reward; they are predictive of learning success; and, even in infancy, they are heightened preceding events that are predicted to reveal new information 

One of the earliest contributions of cognitive neuroscience research was in establishing that dyslexia was “neurobiological in origin,” in that brain signatures for reading differ between groups of readers with and without dyslexia 

The field of MBE began with great excitement as modern neuroimaging techniques allowed for visualization and measurement of the brain bases of learning, how that develops from infancy through adulthood, and how that varies in different kinds of learners 

One significant contribution of MBE was that powerful evidence became available for the brain bases of learning differences, such as dyslexia 

We distill the insights from the individual contributions into three main challenges hindering MBE’s influence on educational practice and policy: (1) inter-individual heterogeneity, (2) limited generalizability, and (3) gaps in the implementation of scientific evidence 

For neuroscience to advance education, it is critical to understand how the nervous system relates to behavior by examining the associations between measures of the brain and variation in some behavior 

To address issues of optimizing sample sizes and increasing reliability, the field has been moving toward multi-lab collaborations, resulting in consortia with thousands of participants (e.g., Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study; Volkow et al, 2018) and in-depth multi-session characterization of individuals using precision neuroimaging approaches (Grotton et al, 2022) 

These approaches will enable a comprehensive understanding of how the brain is related to behavior 

There has been a shift toward increased focus on engaging and training diverse communities in research and transitioning research from labs to schools and communities

;Students' Perceived Roles, Opportunities, and Challenges of a Generative AI-powered Teachable Agent: A Case of Middle School Math Class;I. Introduction;;2024;;Ongoing advancements in Generative AI (GenAI) have boosted the potential of applying long-standing “learning-by-teaching” practices in the form of a teachable agent (TA). Despite the recognized roles and opportunities of TAs, less is known about how GenAI could create synergy or introduce challenges in TAs and how students perceived the application of GenAI in TAs. This study explored middle school students’ perceived roles, benefits, and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs in an authentic mathematics classroom. Through classroom observation, focus-group interviews, and open-ended surveys of 108 sixth-grade students, we found that students expected the GenAI-powered TA to serve as a learning companion, facilitator, and collaborative problem-solver. Students also expressed the benefits and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs. This study provides implications for the design of educational AI and AI-assisted instruction.;mathematics;large language models;learning by teaching;ChatGPT;teachable agent;Fair;"108 sixth-grade students; acknowledges limitations.";"The findings suggest implications regarding the future development of Generative AI-powered teachable agent, instructional design of the pedagogical strategies, and the expected roles of human teachers in GenAI-assisted learning 

This study illustrates the roles, advantages, and challenges of learning with GenAI-powered TA as expressed by middle school students. The findings suggest a great potential for GenAI to realize the long-standing pedagogical strategy of learning-by-teaching in computer-assisted learning environments with more advanced levels of humanlike interactions and pedagogical support. Compared to traditional TAs, students who experienced learning with the GenAI-powered TA perceived similar and expanded roles for GenAI-powered TAs, such as collaborative problemsolvers. Also, students not only expressed the benefits that had been already discussed with traditional TAs (e.g., improving subject-matter knowledge (Biswas et al, 2016)) but also demonstrated the development of AI literacy and positive attitudes toward AI, which is often a learning goal for AIED efforts (Song et al, 2023).The findings suggest implications regarding the future development of GenAI-powered TA, instructional design of the pedagogical strategies, and the expected roles of human teachers in GenAI-assisted learning. First, the identified TA-related barriers echo the ones found in previous studies concerning effective feedback mechanisms and adaptive learning content customization of the TA (Segedy et al, 2012; Tärning, 2018). GenAI holds the potential to address this problem with adequate prompt engineering. For example, the generation of TA’s questions or feedback utterances should consider established taxonomies of questions (e.g., Bloom &amp; Krathwohl, 2020) or effective tutoring strategies (Vygotsky &amp; Cole., 1978) to promote higher-order, thought-provoking questions, and cognitively challenging interactions. Meanwhile, TAs could be designed to include learning analytics to provide adaptive recommendations and personalized learning paths, sequences, and experiences to support different learning styles (Kjällander &amp; Blair, 2021). Furthermore, TAs could be developed to support multiple modalities tailored to individual preferences for communication, transforming the interaction with TAs through multi-modal inputs and outputs (e.g., images, audio, or video) (Driess et al, 2023).";"The findings suggest a great potential for GenAI to realize the long-standing pedagogical strategy of learning-by-teaching in computer-assisted learning environments with more advanced levels of humanlike interactions and pedagogical support

journal-article;Teaching Artificial Intelligence to K-12 Through a Role-Playing Game Questioning the Intelligence Concept;"Julie Henry; Alyson Hernalesteen; Anne-Sophie Collard";KI - Künstliche Intelligenz;2021;10.1007/s13218-021-00733-7;Although artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important in the media environment (search engines, chatbots, home assistants, recommendation systems, etc.), the general audiences’ knowledge of it remains limited, which biases their representations. To compensate for this, some governments show an interest in teaching it from an early age. It appears that educational resources related to AI literacy in schools are most often focused on technical skills. However, the challenges of such education are also ethical and societal, requiring an interdisciplinary and critical approach. This research aims at developing a 10–14 years old curriculum questioning the concept of intelligence in AI systems, and crossing computer science education and media literacy education. Through a role-playing game, the children discover the basic concepts of machine learning. Beyond their initial representations, which they become aware that they are largely fueled by the media, they can realize that an AI system is the result of design choices and that it only works within the framework that has been defined for it. Moreover, the possibility for teachers to teach the curriculum themselves in their classes is also evaluated. To this end, the curriculum was taught to 60 future trainee teachers, 70 middle school pupils, and 12 elementary pupils. Interviews were conducted also with 5 teachers who had either observed the curriculum taught by a researcher or attempted to teach it themselves. The results show that the children’s representations have evolved towards representations that are more technically correct (although incomplete), but not very oriented towards aspects that open up critical questioning. The difficulties revealed in the implementation of the critical part are due in particular to the complexity of the IT concepts to be addressed, but also to the lack of teacher training. However, the data collected seems to confirm the interest and feasibility of crossing different disciplinary approaches to address certain aspects of AI. In conclusion, in addition to the curriculum, this paper describes a theoretical model of critical citizenship education in technology that integrates approaches to computer science education and media literacy education, and gives avenues for other designers and researchers to create AI critical educational experiences for K-12 learners.;design-based research;artificial intelligence;Computer science education;K-12;Representation;;;"The research project we conducted was aimed at designing an artificial intelligence curriculum focused on both the computational and critical issues raised by the theoretical reference model 

The research project we conducted was aimed at designing an AI curriculum focused on both the computational and critical issues raised by the theoretical reference model.";"Regarding the expected change in representation among children, just over 10% of middle school pupils clearly referred to the data in their post-test responses. 5% even discuss the limitations of these data (in terms of errors present) 

More than 17% of these pupils define AI as designed by a human, compared to just 4% before the curriculum";"A large number of considerations on artificial intelligence (AI) relate to the opacity of these technologies: this is the problem of the “black box” [31] 

AI systems are often reduced to robots and are assumed to have capabilities that are far from their real ones 

Fewer are accessible to K-12 educators who typically have limited prior experience with teaching AI [26, 29] 

This research aims at developing a curriculum for 10–14 year olds questioning the concept of intelligence in AI systems, and at crossing computer science education and media literacy education 

– a theoretical model of critical citizenship education in technology that integrates approaches to computer science education, in the field of AI and media literacy education, which provides a framework for critical questioning; 

At the level of critical and ethical reflection, the children will be led to question themselves, during the contextualization and debriefing, on the representations they have of an AI and its role in current media technologies 

In addition to the data collected from the teachers, data on children representations, and on the issues raised during the curriculum implementation were collected through classes observations and recordings 

Several elements provide answers to the two research questions concerning, on the one hand, teachers’ sense of competence and, on the other hand, pupils’ representations. These two questions make it possible to assess whether the designed curriculum is likely to meet both computer science education and media literacy education raised by the theoretical reference model 

The research project we conducted was aimed at designing an AI curriculum focused on both the computational and critical issues raised by the theoretical reference model 

The proposed theoretical model has since been tested in other areas of computer science education, such as cybersecurity and robotics [3]";This research aims at developing a curriculum for 10–14 year olds questioning the concept of intelligence in AI systems, and at crossing computer science education and media literacy education;;The second profile reads the educational materials and took part in the curriculum implemented in their classes by the research team or implemented the curriculum in total autonomy. 5.1.1 A‐Profile Teachers Concerning the form, the five teachers are globally positive;"Conclusion and Future Work The research project conducted was aimed at designing an AI curriculum focused on both the computational and critical issues raised by the theoretical reference model. The results seem to confirm the interest and feasibility of crossing different disciplinary approaches to address different aspects of AI and reveal a difficulty in “dosing” each of them to meet technical and critical educational objectives 

The complexity of the computer concepts to be addressed played a role in this, to the detriment of the development of the critical part, which was relegated to the background";"It should be taken into account here that the sample is limited and that the curriculum was implemented by a volunteer teacher, not the researchers 

There appears to be a marked change in the children’s representations, with the majority of them providing, following the activity, more “correct” definitions of AI at the computer level, of which they seemed to have less prior knowledge 

The results obtained may be partly due to a limitation in the method used to collect the representations, namely the pre- and post-tests 

The results “on the pupils’ side” argue for more time for children to exchange with their teacher and with their classmates and more examples in the documentation to support discussions";The research project we conducted was aimed at designing an AI curriculum focused on both the computational and critical issues raised by the theoretical reference model;Builds on existing methods: “the results in the field, this approach recommends experiments in real contexts, close collaboration between researchers and practitioners (teachers), and a team combining different types of expertise depending on the subject matter and the nature of the educational materials”;Confirms observations from previous studies: “These different methods, and through them the variety of data collected, led to an understanding of the entire learning environment (“ecology of learning”), as recommended by Cobb et al [4]. The analysis of all these data, carried out using an inductive approach of the “grounded theory” type [14, 20], provided a solid basis for developing the curriculum at each iteration, whether in terms of substance (modification of the instructions to get the children to think about optimization and to manage the problems) or form (change in the number of animals in the set, an adaptation of the instructions for better understanding, etc.).”;While contrasting other reports from prior research: “For the 10–14 age group, which is the focus of the curriculum described in this paper, the authors recommend experimenting with and becoming familiar with AI concepts and solving a problem independently. However, as Elish and Boyd [11] point out, simply describing AI techniques without considering how they are represented and socially contextualized is missing the point.”;;;;;;;43;
journal-article;UNDERSTANDING TEACHER PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIENCES AFTER DEPLOYMENT OF AI LITERACY CURRICULUM IN MIDDLE-SCHOOL CLASSROOMS;"Prerna Ravi; Annalisa Broski; Glenda Stump et al.";ICERI proceedings;2023;10.21125/iceri.2023.1716;Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its associated applications are ubiquitous in today’s world, making it imperative that students and their teachers understand how it works and the ramifications arising from its usage. In this study, we investigate the experiences of seven teachers following their implementation of modules from the MIT RAICA (Responsible AI for Computational Action) curriculum. Through semistructured interviews, we investigated their instructional strategies as they engaged with the AI curriculum in their classroom, how their teaching and learning beliefs about AI evolved with the curriculum as well as how those beliefs impacted their implementation of the curriculum. Our analysis suggests that the AI modules not only expanded our teachers’ knowledge in the field, but also prompted them to recognize its daily applications and their ethical and societal implications, so that they could better engage with the content they deliver to students. Teachers were able to leverage their own interdisciplinary backgrounds to creatively introduce foundational AI topics to students to maximize engagement and playful learning. Our teachers advocated their need for better external support when navigating technological resources, additional time for preparation given the novelty of the curriculum, more flexibility within curriculum timelines, and additional accommodations for students of determination.

Some teachers were apprehensive about facilitating challenging conversations about AI and its ethical implications with their students 

Preparing teachers for engaging in discussions about fears students have of traversing an unknown technical landscape would require additional PD training and examples on moderating difficult conversations in class 

This approach has been utilised in other work resulting in teachers’ increased comfort in having conversations about AI ethics as well as using AI tools [18] 

The inclusion of such materials in the Responsible AI for Computational Action (RAICA) curriculum would likely increase teachers’ competence and self-confidence in multiple areas, adding to their productivity and efficacy for students. Inclusivity is another key factor to consider when deploying AI curricula 

Hands-on and unplugged activities can increase the accessibility of the curriculum for classrooms with limited access to technology [19], allowing students to learn something about AI without programming themselves

This holistic perspective empowered students to critically evaluate the implications of AI applications across various domains, which aligned well with teachers’ own perspectives on responsible use of AI (that they had gained from learning about AI through the PD sessions). When guiding students in the creation of innovative AI-driven solutions for everyday challenges, teachers emphasized the significance of considering a broad spectrum of users. They focussed on three major domains of ethical considerations–awareness and consideration of stakeholders, intended and unintended impacts, and industry-aligned design values. These gave students the opportunity to retrieve and use prior learning. These activities also gave authentic avenues to consider the societal ramifications of new information that students were learning.

According to Bazeley, “qualitative analysis is fundamentally case-oriented” (2013, p. 5). A case study is a valuable approach for researchers to explore in depth a phenomenon in a process, program, event, activity or other context (Baxter and Jack, 2008; Creswell, 2014). This approach allows researchers to apply any method of data collection (Priya, 2021) and underscores the situated interrelatedness of various characteristics and causes of the particular phenomenon (Bazeley, 2013).Led by this approach, the present study chose generative AI-related online news coverage on BBC News as a case based on two considerations. First, BBC is one of the most influential public service broadcasters in the world and always embraces the unique value of public service broadcasting (BBC, 2004). The BBC News website remained at the top of visits among 50 influential news media (Majid, 2024), which can be regarded as representative compared with other news media. Second, public service broadcasting is a kind of media aiming to guard citizens’ integrity and interests and, meanwhile, inform, educate and entertain audiences (Banerjee and Seneviratne, 2006, p. 12; Gorham, 1967, p. 221, cited in Grummell, 2009, p. 270). The information published by these media is often perceived as authoritative information and also a good lens through which to observe what is going on in society. Overall, the news coverage published by BBC News is a proper case for analysis.";"By analyzing 78 news articles, generative AI is found to be portrayed in the news in the following ways: Generative AI is primarily used in generating texts, images, audio and videos

Emphasis is placed on elucidating the pivotal role played by AI electronic images in elevating the proficiency of middle school teachers. Subsequently, an integrated intelligent device serves as the foundation for establishing a model that applies intelligent classification and algorithms based on the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO). This model is designed to assess the cognitive literacy and teaching efficacy of middle school educators, and its performance is juxtaposed with classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and decision trees. The findings reveal that, following 600 iterations of the model, the SVM algorithm achieves a 77% accuracy rate in recognizing teacher literacy, whereas the SOLO algorithm attains 80%. Concurrently, the spatial complexities of the SVM-based and SOLO-based intelligent literacy improvement models are determined to be 45 and 22, respectively. Notably, it is discerned that, with escalating iterations, the SOLO algorithm exhibits higher accuracy and reduced spatial complexity in evaluating teachers’ pedagogical literacy. Consequently, the utilization of AI methodologies proves highly efficacious in advancing electronic imaging technology and enhancing the efficacy of image recognition in educational instruction.;Artificial intelligence;secondary school;support vector machine;;;Fair;"120 student samples; acknowledges limitations; provides data.";"The results indicate that at a model iteration of 100, the support vector machine-based teacher literacy recognition achieves an accuracy of 69% 

In summary, the integration of AI electronic images into middle school teacher training and pedagogy offers diverse applications. It digitizes and personalizes training content, provides multimedia learning resources and online communication platforms, and fosters professional growth among educators. Furthermore, it serves as an auxiliary tool during the teaching process, presenting abstract concepts, simulating experiments, and offering interactive experiences to enhance student interest and understanding. Additionally, it facilitates teacher evaluation and feedback, providing objective data and guidance for continuous improvement in teaching methods and overall instructional quality.

;Youth Perceptions of AI Ethics: A Q Methodology Approach;;;2025;;AI technology advancement has sparked a global initiative to educate youth on AI ethics. Understanding students' prior knowledge is vital. This study delves into the diverse perceptions of AI ethics among Korean middle school students using Q methodology. Four types emerged: Privacy Guardians, AI Coexistence Pursuers, AI Ethics Conservatives, and Domestic Distributive Justice Advocates. These classifications reflect the students' concerns, attitudes toward AI, and value preferences. Despite differences, consensus exists on the importance of human dignity, while opinions vary on social justice fairness. The findings suggest the need for tailored educational strategies built on students' perceptions to foster balanced ethical reflection. Keywords: AI ethics, Q methodology, student perception, AI literacy, AIED;Q methodology;AI ethics;artificial intelligence;Institutional Review Board;AI literacy;;;"The findings suggest the need for tailored educational strategies built on students' perceptions to foster balanced ethical reflection 

In conclusion, Type 4, characterized as ‘'Advocates for Domestic Distributive Justice,' advocates for regulatory intervention in AI ethics to address issues like monopolization of technology and wealth accumulation. They emphasize social responsibility and equality in AI development and utilization, opposing the monopolization of AI technology and wealth accumulation for privileged groups. However, despite advocating for oversight bodies for AI, they express a dismissive attitude towards AI biases and oppose extensive supervision of AI ethics in certain aspects. This nuanced stance reflects their belief in government intervention to promote social equality while also highlighting their reservations regarding the scope of oversight in AI governance.";The findings suggest the need for tailored educational strategies built on students' perceptions to foster balanced ethical reflection;"The concourse was developed through an extensive literature review on AI ethics and in-depth interviews with experts who have experience in developing AI ethics education materials, as well as a AI technology developer, considering the context of AI ethics education being implemented within the subject of 'ethics' in South Korea 

Type 2 strongly disagreed “AI should not infringe on human creativity (Q14)”, “AI technology should not be monopolized (Q2)”, “The development of AI should contribute to a more equitable society (Q6)”, and “AI should not be employed to amass wealth for privileged classes (Q5)” 

Due to their firm stance on preserving the distinction between humans and AI, Type 3 is labelled as 'AI Ethics Conservatives.' Type 3 strongly affirms statements such as “AI should not infringe upon human creativity (Q14)”, “AI must respect and protect human dignity (Q13)”, “The relationship between humans and AI should be dominated by humans (Q15)”, and “AI should not infringe upon human autonomy (Q11)” 

Type 3 strongly disagreed “Those who are less accessible to AI technology must be taken into account (Q4)”, ‘The economic prosperity generated by AI should benefit both developed and developing countries (Q3)”, “AI technology should not be monopolized (Q2)” 

Type 4 strongly disagrees with statements such as “AI should not be prejudiced against certain groups (Q9)”, “It is necessary to clarify who is responsible for problems caused by AI technology (Q26)”, “The economic prosperity generated by AI should benefit both developed and developing countries (Q3)”, and “When creating AI ethics, technology developers must participate (Q18)” 

The perspectives revealed through Q analysis align with previous studies on public and student perceptions of AI and robots

preprint;AI Audit: A Card Game to Reflect on Everyday AI Systems;"Safinah Ali; Vishesh Kumar; Cynthia Breazeal";;2023;;"An essential element of K-12 AI literacy is educating learners about the ethical and societal implications of AI systems. Previous work in AI ethics literacy have developed curriculum and classroom activities that engage learners in reflecting on the ethical implications of AI systems and developing responsible AI. There is little work in using game-based learning methods in AI literacy. Games are known to be compelling media to teach children about complex STEM concepts. In this work, we developed a competitive card game for middle and high school students called ""AI Audit"" where they play as AI start-up founders building novel AI-powered technology. Players can challenge other players with potential harms of their technology or defend their own businesses by features that mitigate these harms. The game mechanics reward systems that are ethically developed or that take steps to mitigate potential harms. In this paper, we present the game design, teacher resources for classroom deployment and early playtesting results.

We designed a card game for middle and high school students to reflect on the ethical implications of everyday AI systems. The competitive game facilitates children’s learning about how AI-powered businesses can have negative impacts and how these businesses can mitigate those impacts. The game is designed to facilitate conversation between the players to critically reflect on and discuss their thoughts about how various technologies harm us. The cards are scaffolded in a way that aims to make children aware of how their everyday technology can potentially be harmful in ways that they do not anticipate. The goal is to help them be responsible consumers and creators of AI. In our initial playtesting with adults, we found that the game was engaging and fun, even for adults, but players also found some content challenging. We found that the accompanying education materials were helpful and that players gained new insights about societal implications that they were not aware of, or were reminded to think critically about the ones that they were aware of.";"Over 60% of players participate in offline or online social communities related to their gameplay (Picton, Clark, and Judge 2020) 

2. Crime prediction tool that can predict future crimes one week in advance with about 90% accuracy";"The AI4k12 initiative that was established by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) has determined the “Big 5 ideas in AI” which determine what students should know about AI and be able to do with it (Touretzky et al 2019) 

Previous work has used teaching lectures where instructors discuss how certain AI systems have impacted society, or unplugged activities where students reflect on who stakeholders of the technology are and how they could be positive or negatively impacted, or project-based learning approaches where students designing an algorithm reflect on its societal implications and minimize harm 

In 2018, AAAI and CSTA developed national guidelines for teaching AI to K-12 students, where they outlined 5 big ideas that all students must know: computers perceive the world using sensors, agents maintain models/representations of the world and use them for reasoning, computers can learn from data, making agents interact comfortably with humans is a substantial challenge for AI developers, and AI applications can impact society in both positive and negative ways (Touretzky et al 2019) 

Players play as business owners that set up new businesses - an attempt to replicate the real world creators of technology who are reflecting on the ethical implications of the AI-powered businesses they are creating 

Noticing even our adult playtesters being surprised by different connections between technologies and harms, and ways to respond to potential harms, surfaced a key value of how games enable just in time and contextualized learning (Gee 2007)

While existing works in K-12 AI Ethics literacy enable children to critique existing AI technologies and identify their potential harms, this work allows them to put themselves in the shoes of the creators of these technologies and conceptualize their responsible redesign, while being supported by learning materials that scaffold their knowledge about AI-enabled societal harms

Players play as business owners that set up new businesses - an attempt to replicate the real world creators of technology who are reflecting on the ethical implications of the AI-powered businesses they are creating. We focussed on our intended audience of middle and high schoolers while thinking about AI technologies and businesses that would be familiar to them, and have implications on their life for instance, recommender systems for social media, and face filters for camera apps. In addition to our prior expertise and media awareness, we leaned on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy’s debate highlights (Müller 2021) to come up with descriptions of harms that are both easy to grasp for youth, and map to different subsets of the businesses we came up with (for instance, manipulating people’s buying behaviors coming directly from the debate around manipulation of behaviors which can happen in a wide plethora of ways from AI systems). Lastly, we came up with features that can respond to mitigate different harms we picked for the game, which also significantly overlapped with the key themes highlighted by Fjeld et al as important considerations for the creation and assessment of AI systems (For instance, “Making the underlying AI technology and data usage transparent” as a feature in our game clearly corresponds to the theme of Transparency and Accountability). 

AI Concepts Addressed &amp; Expected Learning Outcomes: Students will be made aware of real-world examples of harms caused by commonly available and used AI systems and examples of design and development practices AI creators can implement to mitigate negative impacts of their creations. Students will role play as AI creators and founders and practice thinking critically about the societal implications of the businesses they want to set up and how they can responsibly design their business. 

The game consisted of three kinds of cards: Business Cards, Harm Cards and Feature Cards, listed below along with the game rule connections describing which harms can be caused by different businesses, and which features can address different harms.

Additionally, we also created a Wild Harm Card and a Wild Feature Card (Figure 1), which were intended to provide creative space to players to come up with their own harm that a business might be causing, or their own feature that can mitigate a harm challenge played against them. All game materials are provided for anyone to download and print 111https://bit.ly/3BxW3M1. 

This game is designed to be played by up to 7 players at a time, alongside educator facilitation depending on learners’ prior experiences with AI and technological literacy and comfort in engaging in discussion. AI Audit consists of 3 kinds of cards: Business (14), Harm (13 x 3), Feature (8 x 2). The aim of the game is to choose and run a technology business which is able to implement appropriate features to mitigate causing harms. The player with the last surviving business wins. 

SETUP: The game is set up by distributing all the Business cards across all players evenly (returning any extras to the box), and arranging the Harm and Feature cards face down in two separate decks. Players decide who goes first and play follows clockwise order. In the first round, each player draws 2 Harm and 3 Feature cards randomly (keeping all cards in their hand secret from others), and plays 1 Business card from their hand face down in front of them – the action of setting it up. 

TURN: After this setup, in each turn, a player can either set up a Business or play a Harm card against another player’s Business. Each Business card has a set of colors indicating which harms it can cause. A player can only play a Harm card against a business if their Harm card’s color is in the list of colors corresponding to the business. 

This challenge should be accompanied with a more detailed description of what this harm looks like. This description can come from players’ own understanding and intuition, the accompanying materials that players are provided as a part of the game, or from the supporting teacher to share explanations of what these harms look like for different businesses. While not mandatory for gameplay, we expect this conversational space to be the key venue for players to engage in conversation and deepen their understanding about such businesses and technologies, and the harms they can cause. 

Each challenged player gets a chance to respond to the challenging Harm with a Feature card. Similar to Business cards, Feature cards also have a set of colors indicating which Harms they can respond to. Players should only play Feature cards if their colors match the color of the Harm card played against them. If the challenged player has a matching Feature card and plays it, the Harm challenge fails – both the Harm and Feature card go to the bottom of their corresponding decks, and both players get to draw a replacement Harm and Feature card (Figure 2). 

This is another juncture where players are encouraged to provide a more detailed description of how they think the Feature actually obviates the Harm that their business might have been causing. As in the case above, this description can come from players’ own understanding, accompanying educational materials, or accompanying educator support. Wild Feature cards can be played against any harm, but should be accompanied by a narrative on how it obviates the challenging Harm. Being able to convince a majority of the players that their imagined Feature is appropriate for the Harm challenge enables them to succeed against the Harm challenge. 

If players do not have an appropriate Feature to play against a Harm, the Harm challenge succeeds and they lose the challenged Business which goes to the discard pile. If a player has no running Business in their turn, they have to set up a Business. They can also choose to set up a second or third Business in their turn if they want to. 

Educational Materials: The game is accompanied with an AI audit guide: including the gameplay rules outlined above, and real-life instances to describe the relations between different AI businesses and all their in-game corresponding harms. We expect these to be learning resources and conversation starters for students. The following is an excerpt from the AI audit guide: Hiring algorithms that automates hiring in big companies to reduce the time taken to go through thousands of resumes. 

Algorithmic bias discriminating people based on their race, gender, ethnicity, or occupation: Resume sorters often make use of historical data with demographic information to make decisions about new data. This historical data might often have algorithmic biases, or might prefer candidates based on their race, gender, economic status or even their name. A recent study found that hiring algorithms are more likely to select applicants with common white names like Emily or Greg, versus distinctively Black names like Jamal or Lakisha. 

Taking over existing human jobs: Replacing a human recruiter with an automated hiring system may be time efficient, but what happens to the human recruiter’s job? Is it now redundant? According to a recent survey, companies are increasingly adopting AI powered screening tools for the first round of resume sorting, dramatically altering human recruiters’ jobs. 

When played in classroom settings, the AI Audit guide is also a useful resource for teachers to facilitate discussions and provide concrete examples from real life to support the Harm and Feature cards. 

We conducted an initial playtesting of the card game with five adults (four graduate students and one professional; age range 21 to 30 years) accompanied by one observer. Two out of the five players had prior expertise with AI. While this player group did not reflect our game’s intended player age group, it gave us initial playtesting feedback to improvise the gameplay. The observer used the AI Audit guide booklet to read out the rules to the players. We observed for: (1) challenges that players had in understanding the gameplay, (2) whether gameplay went as intended, (3) how engaging the game was, and (4) players’ reflections on AI ethics concepts after the game. players were informed that the game design is in progress and any feedback they have would be helpful for iterating the game. Post gameplay players were asked the following questions: 

Did you learn anything new about the societal and ethical effects of AI? 

Several changes emerged from this initial round of testing. 

Simplifying the language of some Business cards and adding familiar words. For instance, “Conversational Agents” can be changed to “Voice Agents like Alexa”. Further, we aim to make it more explicit how these businesses involve AI and make the text length shorter. 

Colors on the cards can be made more distinct, and can be accompanied by distinct shapes to make them easy to differentiate. As one player pointed out, this will also be friendly for players with color-blindness.

Touretzky et al state that “students should understand that the ethical construction of AI systems that make decisions affecting people’s lives requires attention to the issues of transparency and fairness” (Touretzky et al 2019). In this section we present some of the salient ethical issues that are currently being discussed.The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy provides a summary of a breadth of work from the burgeoning field of AI ethics surfacing prominent debates about AI systems with notable potential for harm (Müller 2021). These include: Privacy &amp; Surveillance, Manipulation of Behavior, Opacity of AI Systems, Bias in Decision Systems, Human-Robot Interaction, Automation and Employment, Autonomous Systems, Machine Ethics, Artificial Moral Agents, and Singularity. These provide a wide enough basis accessible for key conversations around how a variety of AI systems impact people and society, and what are different ways to respond to the same.";;;0;

This paper reports on an alternative model for “doing ethics” via co-design with young people, highlighting the need for students to engage in AI ethics work, especially as AI is increasingly used in their education and social lives. In particular, we focus on developing a rights-based approach, using the White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights as a starting point for redesigning core AI ethics principles and their conveyance to be accessible and relevant to young people, in collaboration with young people. In this manuscript, we describe our empirical work in a series of three studies on AI ethics teaching and learning with middle and high school students, which culminated in redesigning pieces of the AI Bill of Rights. We present lessons learned, implications for responsible AI in education from student perspectives, and conclude with our suggested principles for integrating student insight and perspectives into the ethics frameworks that guide AI applications.;artificial intelligence;ChatGPT;United States;young people;United Nations;;;"This paper reports on an alternative model for “doing ethics” via co-design with young people, highlighting the need for students to engage in AI ethics work, especially as AI is increasingly used in their education and social lives

Along with the sluggish pace of AI legislation in the United States (US) generally, it is essential that we look to efforts from beyond the US for precedent and inspiration for rights-based and other policy guidance relating to AI and young people 

There are a growing number of studies reporting on rich collaborative policy-making and ethical discussion around AI in educational settings (e.g., see Swist et al.’s 2023 paper describing “ethical co-production” through Deliberative Democracy (DD) in a higher education setting), there remains a dearth of research focusing on co-designing with students, at the elementary and secondary school level (Sarmiento &amp; Wise, 2022) 

Through careful engagement with student artifacts and analysis from each case, along with our conceptual grounding in critical digital literacy and co-design research and practice as theory we are “thinking with” (Jackson &amp; Mazzei, 2012), we have developed a set of recommendations, or principles, based on our experiences in these studies that we think may be useful for guiding others’ pursuits in AI ethics education with young people 

This progression reflects the historical thread and context of this work, which builds over several iterations occurring both before and after inflection points in discourse around AI ethics, including the publication of the Blueprint and the release of ChatGPT to the public 

This work is animated by questions about AI, ethics, education, and students: What should an AI Bill of Rights for Young People look like, and how should it be enforced? (Why) should we have one? How should we use one–or its pursuit–in AI ethics education for and with young people? 

With the recent flurry of discussion about AI in education, it is easy to forget that AI has been influencing our lives for quite some time 

Our role as caring adults is to leverage our status and resources to lift up the voices and perspectives of young people: to consider them capable and worthy of shaping the world; to dream of their potential but value them as they are; to provide them with access and opportunities to learn about technology and rights; and to make sure we are worthy of their trust, and to trust them with consequential contributions to policy 

We offer this set of principles for redesigning AI rights as one way that adults can open conversations with young people about AI in ways that are not inherently punitive 

We see a great deal of room for rightsbased work with youth and AI ethics, and we dream that these activities might help youth advocate for their own rights";;"In the following sections, we report on three “cases,” or analyses of focal data from larger studies that illustrate key developments in our exploration of AI ethics with young people. We draw from a series of three studies with middle and high school students to build a set of considerations and recommendations for incorporating AI ethics into middle and high school education, examining data from specific activities within each study to provide illustrative examples in the form of three cases. Each study had unique participants (see summary in Table 1), but all studies were linked by a common concern with implementing and improving curriculum designed to involve students in AI ethics work. 

Case 1 comes from a study where the first author designed and implemented a nine-week AI ethics unit at a local private school, teaching seventh and eighth grade students during their respective science blocks for an academic quarter. For Cases 2 and 3, students were recruited from STEM-focused middle and high school programs that are part of an established partnership between a metropolitan public school district and a private research university. 

The middle school program is a pull-out, one-day-a-week experience, where students in grades 7 and 8 visit the university for 3 hours of educational instruction. In contrast to the high school program, cohorts

are school-specific and participants do not receive course credits. Students in good standing at their home schools are allowed to apply to the program and selected based on their desire to be active participants in rigorous, hands-on STEM activities. Case 2 comes from one unit of the middle school program. 

The high school program is a four-year, interdisciplinary, researchcentered learning experience, where grade-level cohorts of 26 students from across the school district attend credit-bearing classes at the program one day a week on the university campus. Program enrollment is application-based for academically motivated eighth graders who are planning to attend a district-operated high school. Case 3 comes from a summer “AI Forum” with two cohorts of these students. 

55 students enrolled in the middle school program and 50 students enrolled in the high school program participated in this research (see demographic information in Table 1 below). 

From the larger corpus of video, audio, and text/image data we collected within each study, we selected relevant focal data that illustrate a broader trend or inflection point in our thinking about AI ethics for youth. Each study variously employed qualitative research theory and technique to find themes and interesting moments or elements of student speech, art, and writing, including coding (Saldana, 2021) and textual analysis (Fairclough &amp; Fairclough, 2015). 

For this analysis, researchers identified relevant focal data sources or codes from each study, reviewing them independently and/or collaboratively (with a subset of the research team) to develop themes and highlight moments of interest for interpreting the redesign process. The principles described below reflect the product of analysis and reflection within, between, and across the cases, including formal analytical procedures like coding of video transcripts and close readings of student work, as well as our reflections as educators (e.g., in field notes, conversations among subsets of the research team, and in collaborative planning sessions for subsequent units). Since each study involved overlapping but different team members, parts of the data collection and analysis process were led initially by an individual researcher, then discussed with others on the team. Through careful engagement with student artifacts and analysis from each case, along with our conceptual grounding in critical digital literacy and co-design research and practice as theory we are “thinking with” (Jackson &amp; Mazzei, 2012), we have developed a set of recommendations, or principles, based on our experiences in these studies that we think may be useful for guiding others’ pursuits in AI ethics education with young people.";"Each case comes from a different study in a series of AI ethics teaching studies conducted between 2022 and 2024

journal-article;Developing and validating measures for AI literacy tests: From self-reported to objective measures;"Thomas K. F. Chiu; Yifan Chen; King Woon Yau et al.";Computers and Education Artificial Intelligence;2024;10.1016/j.caeai.2024.100282;The majority of AI literacy studies have designed and developed self-reported questionnaires to assess AI learning and understanding. These studies assessed students' perceived AI capability rather than AI literacy because self-perceptions are seldom an accurate account of true measures. International assessment programs that use objective measures to assess science, mathematical, digital, and computational literacy back up this argument. Furthermore, because AI education research is still in its infancy, the current definition of AI literacy in the literature may not meet the needs of young students. Therefore, this study aims to develop and validate an AI literacy test for school students within the interdisciplinary project known as AI4future. Engineering and education researchers created and selected 25 multiple-choice questions to accomplish this goal, and school teachers validated them while developing an AI curriculum for middle schools. 2,390 students in grades 7 to 9 took the test. We used a Rasch model to investigate the discrimination, reliability, and validity of the items. The results showed that the model met the unidimensionality assumption and demonstrated a set of reliable and valid items. They indicate the quality of the test items. The test enables AI education researchers and practitioners to appropriately evaluate their AI-related education interventions.;AI literacy;K–12;Artificial intelligence;Instrument;K-12;Fair;"2390 students; acknowledges limitations; provides data.";"we created and tested an Artificial intelligence literacy instrument that performed well in terms of discrimination, reliability, and validity 

In this study, we created and tested an AI literacy instrument that performed well in terms of discrimination, reliability, and validity. This study also has four major limitations. First, since literacy closely relates to knowledge and skills, its assessment should incorporate practical skills and hands-on activities. Future studies should suggest items for the practical tests. Second, only six Hong Kong schools participated in this test. We need more extensive research to validate the instrument’s feasibility and stability. Third, all of the participants and experts were from Hong Kong, so the questionnaire may not be appropriate for investigating AI education among students in western countries. We encourage the conduct of cross-sectional and regional research on AI literacy assessment using this test in the future, to establish a scientific foundation for its use in AI education intervention studies. Final: AI education for K–12 is still in its infancy. More investigation is needed to determine what the student should learn and what knowledge and skills they should acquire. Future studies may be expanded to include more skills and knowledge for assessment.";"The results showed that the model met the unidimensionality assumption and demonstrated a set of reliable and valid items 

The results showed that the Rasch model met the unidimensionality assumption, demonstrated reliable item and person reliability indices, and had acceptable infit values";"There is a growing focus on AI education in K-12, there is a significant lack of objective evaluation approach for measuring student AI literacy 

The ideas are: 1) “Computers perceive the world using sensors”; 2) “Agents maintain models or representations of the world and use them for reasoning”; 3) “Computers can learn from data”; 4) “Making agents interact with humans is a substantial challenge for AI developers”; and 5) “AI applications can impact society in both positive and negative ways.” 

All graders learned about AI and its careers; 3rd to 5th graders learned how to use teachable machines; 6th to 8th graders learned about creative AI; and 9th to 12th graders learned about AI in social media 

These studies have mixed findings on what AI content should include in certain grades, but they can be summarized into three areas: knowledge of AI, process in AI, and impact of AI (Chiu, 2021) 

They inform researchers and practitioners what to include in AI curriculum content for K–12 that is directly associated with the abilities of AI literacy (Casal-Otero et al, 2023) 

Laupichler et al (2023) and Ng and colleagues (2022) used the definitions from engineering perspectives to suggest self-reported questionnaire items to assess AI literacy.

Digital literacy facilitates effective communication and collaboration among other healthcare providers. It helps to navigate the ethical implications of using digital technologies and aids the use of digital tools in managing healthcare processes. Our aim in this study is to determine the digital literacy level and awareness of our students receiving health-based education in our university and to pave the way for supporting the current curriculum with courses on digital literacy when necessary. Method Students from Acibadem University who were registered undergraduate education for at least four years of health-based education, School of Medicine, Nutrition and Dietetics, Nursing, Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Psychology, Biomedical Engineering, Molecular Biology, and Genetics were included. The questionnaire consisted of 24 queries evaluating digital literacy in 7 fields: software and multimedia, hardware and technical problem solving, network and communication/collaboration, ethics, security, artificial intelligence (A.I.), and interest/knowledge. Two student groups representing all departments were invited for interviews according to the Delphi method. Results The survey was completed by 476 students. Female students had less computer knowledge and previous coding education. Spearman correlation test showed that there were weak positive correlations between the years and the “software and multimedia,” “ethics,” “interest and knowledge” domains, and the average score. The students from Nursing scored lowest in the query after those from the Nutrition and Dietetics department. The highest scores were obtained by Biomedical Engineering students, followed by the School of Medicine. Participants scored the highest in “network” and “A.I.” and lowest in “interest-knowledge” domains. Conclusion It is necessary to define the level of computer skills who start health-based education and shape the curriculum by determining which domains are weak. Creating an educational environment that fosters females’ digital knowledge is recommended. Elective courses across faculties may be offered to enable students to progress and discuss various digital literacy topics. The extent to which students benefit from the digital literacy-supported curriculum may be evaluated. Thus, health-based university students are encouraged to acquire the computer skills required by today’s clinical settings.

Hsin Pao Yang; Eun-Hee Goo";Applied Sciences;2024;10.3390/app14041588;Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought convenience to human lives, but its pervasive impact extends beyond individuals, affecting society as a whole. Consequently, the necessity for an AI ethics education program has become increasingly apparent. This study aims to investigate the influence of an experimental research study that developed and implemented an AI ethics education program for learners’ ethical awareness and attitude towards AI. The research methodology involved validating a model of the AI ethics education program by applying it to a group of 10 domain experts. Additionally, pre-test and post-test designs were employed with 17 middle school students as the experimental group. The same assessment was administered before and after the implementation of the AI ethics education program, and the data were analyzed using paired-sample t-tests. The findings of this study are as follows: Firstly, an AI ethics education program model was developed, incorporating key competencies such as AI literacy, critical thinking skills in AI, and AI problem-solving skills, all within the context of AI ethics. The implementation of this model was effective in the educational setting. Secondly, significant improvements were observed in the ethical awareness of middle school students across all domains after participating in the program. Thirdly, the attitudes of middle school students towards AI exhibited significant enhancements across all domains. These findings contribute to the broader field of AI ethics education by highlighting the importance of ethical awareness in AI and fostering favorable attitudes towards AI.

This research aimed to develop an AI ethics education program that fosters the cultivation of ethical consciousness and a positive attitude towards AI among middle school students in order to prepare them for coexistence with AI. The focus of the AI education curriculum was to make learners understand that the judgments made by AI are based on human decisions, and the consequences of these decisions are human responsibilities. This was achieved by providing practical exercises related to data bias. Furthermore, the curriculum aimed to enhance learners’ understanding of AI principles and technologies to effectively manage AI, as well as to educate them about AI’s characteristics. Based on AI literacy core competencies, we designed an eight-session education program that applied these four principles. Additionally, the proposed educational program analyzed not only changes in middle school students’ ethical awareness but also changes in their attitudes toward artificial intelligence. To this end, the teaching and learning process was structured using practical and video materials appropriate for each session, such as AI education series videos, robot videos, and AI future videos, so that the participants could easily comprehend the content. Our approach, which emphasized practical exercises related to data bias and the enhancement of learners’ understanding of AI principles and technologies, was informed by the guidelines provided by official documents and research in the field, echoing the core competencies of AI literacy that have been underscored [47]. In order to develop this AI ethics education program, a model was constructed by researching and analyzing previous studies on AI ethics education, ethical consciousness, attitudes, and the core competencies of literacy. A preliminary teaching and learning process was then designed by applying these core competencies to each of the 8 hours in a total of four classes in the developed model. In order to ensure the validity of the teaching and learning process content, a validation process was carried out by a panel of 10 experts.

Chiu; Zubair Ahmad; Murod Ismailov et al.";Computers and Education Open;2024;10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100171;"Artificial intelligence (AI) education in K–12 schools is a global initiative, yet planning and executing AI education is challenging. The major frameworks are focused on identifying content and technical knowledge (AI literacy). Most of the current definitions of AI literacy for a non-technical audience are developed from an engineering perspective and may not be appropriate for K–12 education. Teacher perspectives are essential to making sense of this initiative. Literacy is about knowing (knowledge, what skills); competency is about applying the knowledge in a beneficial way (confidence, how well). They are strongly related. This study goes beyond knowledge (AI literacy), and its two main goals are to (i) define AI literacy and competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self-reflective mindsets, and (ii) propose a more comprehensive framework for K–12 AI education. These definitions are needed for this emerging and disruptive technology (e.g., ChatGPT and Sora, generative AI). We used the definitions and the basic curriculum design approaches as the analytical framework and teacher perspectives. Participants included 30 experienced AI teachers from 15 middle schools. We employed an iterative co-design cycle to discuss and revise the framework throughout four cycles. The definition of AI competency has five abilities that take confidence into account, and the proposed framework comprises five key components: technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self-reflection. We also identify five effective learning experiences to foster abilities and confidences, and suggest five future research directions: prompt engineering, data literacy, algorithmic literacy, self-reflective mindset, and empirical research.";AI literacy;K–12;STEM;Artificial intelligence;K-12;Fair;"30 experienced ai teachers; acknowledges limitations; provides data.

Designing an effective AI education in K–12 appears to be quite difficult. A few frameworks—""Five Big Ideas in AI,"" AI4future, and a holistic approach—were presented in the literature to help teachers create their curriculum. They do, however, concentrate on recognizing AI content, tools, technical abilities, and thinking. They may not properly provide them with a fundamental understanding and get them ready for a future with AI. To address this issue, this study defined AI competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self-reflective mindsets to AI literacy and proposed a comprehensive framework for AI education in K–12. We believe that the framework promotes inclusive and diverse education, ensuring success for each student [39]. Teachers can design AI education to address students’ needs [37].";;"This study argues that (i) the concepts of self-reflective mindsets should be included in the definition of AI literacy (i.e., AI competency), and practitioner perspectives should be taken into account for designing and developing K–12 AI education 

The findings of this study will contribute to AI education by enhancing our knowledge of AI literacy and competency for K–12 students 

Researchers and practitioners would use the definition and theoretical framework suggested by the findings to design research and learning activities related to AI literacy and competency 

The definition offers suggestions for the content and learning outcomes that should be incorporated in K–12 AI education; the two approaches recommend that effective pedagogies be used 

The definitions of AI literacy and competency and teacher perspectives on pedagogies would contribute to the development of an AI education framework for K–12 

AI literacy is defined as “an individual’s ability to clearly explain how AI technologies work and impact society, as well as to use them in an ethical and responsible manner and to effectively communicate and collaborate with them in any setting 

AI competency is defined as “an individual’s confidence and ability to clearly explain how AI technologies work and impact society, as well as to use them in an ethical and responsible manner and to effectively communicate and collaborate with them in any setting 

This study revised the definition of AI literacy to improve its suitability for K–12 education and defined AI competency by adding the aspects of student confidence and self-reflective mindsets to AI literacy, Research design and procedure 

The teacher participants pointed out that these confidence and ability were associated with the three themes discussed earlier: technology, impact, and ethics. They suggested that “the students need to learn how to prompt effectively when using ChatGPT,” “the students should examine the reliability of the prediction of an AI prediction system,” “the students should be aware of their privacy rights when using AI systems,” and “the students should be aware that AI systems may collect their data, such as locations and voices.” 

This study did not address how teacher capacity affects learning design and development, which is a major limitation given that most teachers do not study AI topics in their education and undergo formal AI training";The primary goal of this study is to propose a framework for K–12 teachers to promote AI literacy and competency;"The two main goals of this paper are to (i) define AI literacy and competency for a non-technical audience, i.e., K–12 education, and (ii) suggest a more comprehensive framework for AI education. How teachers design AI teaching and learning activities directly impacts how and what students learn. Teachers’ perspectives are crucial for making sense of any innovative education [14]. Accordingly, to achieve these two goals, we first presented the definitions of AI literacy and competency and co-designed the framework with experienced AI teachers. The definitions and the curriculum design approaches serve as a lens to reexamine the three major frameworks available in the literature. 

There were a total of 30 teacher participants involved in this study, split evenly between 15 Hong Kong middle schools (2 teachers per school). The teachers’ average age was 32, and there were 24 male and 6 female participants. All of them had at least three years of experience teaching AI. Their academic backgrounds included computer science, mathematics, the sciences, business, design, and technology. Each district had its own set of schools, which ranged in academic quality and social status. Another key participant was a researcher who is a professoriate staff member with an academic background in STEM education, particularly in mathematics and technology. The researcher has five years of experience promoting AI education in middle schools through the creation of learning materials, testing their effectiveness, and providing teacher training. By considering that AI education for K–12 has started in 2019, the participants were experienced. 

Long and Magerko’s [31] definition of AI literacy is exceedingly broad, possibly overly complicated, and unsuitable for the K–12 setting. The inclusion of self-reflective mindsets, which are critical for lifelong learning about emerging AI technology, in the definition was missing. AI technologies are expected to stay, evolve, and have an increasing impact on our lives, work, and studies. More students will learn with more advanced AI technologies; more employees will work with the technologies; and more people will live with the technologies. To succeed in the AI age, students must be able to continuously evaluate their own understanding of AI and stay up-to-date on its advancements. This is in line with the recommendations made by UNESCO about AI competency for educators and students: “The knowledge, skills, and attitudes students should acquire to understand and actively engage with AI in a safe and ethical manner in school and beyond.”. 

This study revised the definition of AI literacy to improve its suitability for K–12 education and defined AI competency by adding the aspects of student confidence and self-reflective mindsets to AI literacy, Research design and procedure 

This study used a co-design approach to propose the framework. The researcher was involved in the design processes and worked together with the teachers. An iterative co-design cycle involving data collection, analysis, and design was conducted. The researcher and teachers contributed to the development of the comprehensive framework through the definitions, design approaches, and three existing major frameworks discussed in the literature review. 

The main researcher began running a 3-hour workshop on the four approaches, the three major frameworks, and the definitions of AI literacy and competency for all the teachers. There were four cycles of data collection. In each cycle, the researcher conducted a meeting with the teachers and collected their comments. The teachers were divided into five groups of six and drafted and revised the framework and learning experiences from the previous cycle (the first cycle used the three major frameworks discussed in the review). Each meeting lasted for 4 h with a 

15-minute break. Thus, the researcher and the participants jointly proposed how AI education should be designed and delivered, and the teachers used the materials as evidence to support their ideas. 

In each of the meetings (i.e., cycles), all the participants co-designed the framework and learning experience with the researcher. At the end of each cycle, the teacher participants voted on the changes to the framework and learning experiences using an immediate response digital platform. We used a 75 percent agreement (consensus) level, aligned with previous similar studies [41]. This level indicates the high reliability of the analysis. 

We used six aspects to discuss the validity of this qualitative design and analysis [15,30]. Appropriateness: First, we used the three major existing AI education frameworks in the literature. Second, the main researcher has designed and delivered AI education for K–12 since 2018 and published more than 15 journal papers related to AI education. The participants were experienced AI education teachers. These show that the methods and materials used for gathering data were suitable for the context and research question. Triangulation: the teachers with different teaching subjects and schools were recruited to avoid individual (subject) biases and provide a more diverse view. Credibility: The credibility of qualitative research is determined by the researcher’s competence in the research process. The authors had experience researching, designing, and teaching AI in different regions. Ethical procedures: The corresponding authors’ university granted ethical permission for this work, addressing the moral implications of this date collection. All the participants understood their rights and gave consent. Transferability: the participants’ major teaching subjects were diverse, which provides a wide possible range of data. Respondent validation: this study was supported by the three major AI education frameworks; thereby, it is credible and valid.";"Technology The first component concerns the core knowledge of AI, which is comparable to the two frameworks proposed by Five Big Ideas in AI and AI4future

Applications of, and media generated by generative AI techniques are abundantly present on social media platforms frequented by children, who are not yet aware of the existence of AI-manipulated media. Previous work has highlighted the importance of digital media literacy and AI literacy for children. In this work, we introduce middle school students to generative AI techniques as a tool for creation, while also focusing on critical discussion about their societal and ethical implications, and encouraging pro-activeness in being responsible consumers, creators and stakeholders of technology. We present learning activities that introduce 38 middle-school students to generative modeling, how it is used to generate Deepfakes, cues that help to recognize Deepfakes, and the spread and effects of misinformation. Students demonstrated an understanding that generative media may be believable, but not necessarily true, and can contribute to the spread of misinformation. They were also able to identify why misinformation may be harmful or lasting, drawing specific examples to social settings that indicate human-centered implications. Finally, students expressed opinions about policies surrounding the presence of Deepfakes on social media. This approach can be adopted to introduce students to other technical systems that constitute both productive applications and potential negative implications of technology. ⋅Applied computing → Interactive learning environments; ⋅Human-centered computing → Social media; Social networks; ⋅Social and professional topics → Computing literacy; K-12 education; Misinformation, Deepfakes, digital literacy, media literacy, social media.";Digital literacy;generative adversarial networks;Misinformation;Media literacy;social media;;;"We confirm that middle school students could successfully conceptualize what Deepfakes are, what misinformation is and how it spreads, and had opinions about policy surrounding Deepfakes - making these appropriate learning goals for this age group 

In this work, we outline an approach to introduce students to Deepfakes which includes understanding the technical systems that create Deepfakes, their implications on spreading misinformation, and potential policies to mitigate their potential harm. We confirm that middle school students could successfully conceptualize what Deepfakes are, what misinformation is and how it spreads, and had opinions about policy surrounding Deepfakes - making these appropriate learning goals for this age group. This work adds to existing literature on digital media literacy by equipping students with the knowledge to think critically about what they see online. However, to our knowledge, this is the only work that introduces students to Deepfakes within a media literacy context. Due to the low barrier to create high quality Deepfakes, this is an especially timely topic with deep societal implications. This is an especially critical curriculum for this age group because of the presence of such media on social media apps frequented by middle school students. This work also contributes to the growing literature around advances in middle school AI literacy (Lee, 2020), specifically ethical AI literacy (Ali et al, 2019; An Ethics of Artificial Intelligence Curriculum for Middle School Students) and creative AI literacy (Ali et al, 2021a, 2021b). We propose the concepts of generative manipulated media that have potential harmful implications to be included in digital media literacy curricula. We also discuss different alternatives to just media literacy, such as considering stakeholders outside of creators and consumers of technology, specifically, government or corporate policies. In our work, we observed that even though students gained an understanding of how Deepfakes are created and how to spot them, they still expressed the need to have policy regulating the presence of Deepfakes on social media. Through these activities, they understood the role of various stakeholders in this socio-technical system: creators of technology, consumers of media and policy makers. These activities also add to work in K-12 AI and CS literacy, specifically around the ethical implications of generative machine learning. We hope that this work inspires educators and curriculum designers to consider both a technical and political approach to digital media literacy. This literacy approach towards socio-technical concepts can be expanded to other technical topics. Finally, while Deepfakes will continue to exist, and get better, children are now better prepared to challenge their authenticity and hinder their spread as misinformation when they encounter them online.";Over 75% of students chose policies that identified and labeled Deepfakes, but did not ban them (Deepfakes Accountability Act and Twitter);"We present interactive classroom activities that aim to make students aware of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), its ability to create Deepfakes, how Deepfakes can be spotted, how it can lead to the spread of misinformation, how misinformation spreads, and some ways to mitigate the spread

However, adoption of these tools remains uneven, raising concerns about disparities in AI literacy and competency across geographic regions and educational contexts. Here we investigate the adoption of GenAI tools among second language (L2) educators in the United States, Colombia, Germany, and Macau—professionals uniquely positioned to benefit from and highlight barriers to GenAI integration. Using survey data, we assess four areas: accessibility of GenAI tools, teacher knowledge of potential applications, integration in teaching practices, and the nature of professional development provided. Our results indicated substantial intra- and inter-country variance, with U.S. and Colombian educators reporting higher familiarity and usage compared to those from Germany and Macau. Additionally, university and high school teachers were more likely to access professional development and leverage GenAI for tasks like assessment and differentiation than elementary or middle school educators, regardless of geographic setting. These disparities align with broader trends in AI adoption, reflecting heterogeneity in cultural attitudes, systemic barriers, and institutional support.

N1 and n2 indicate sample sizes in each respective country and task category. Significant adjusted pvalues are indicated in bold.In contrast to country specific usage patterns, there was not a clear visual signal of usage between most educational levels (Figure 4, Supplemental Figure 8). In general, weekly and monthly usage exceeded daily usage frequencies (Figure 4A). Of the respondents using GenAI in the classroom, there was not a strong signature of usage patterns across task categories varying by level of instruction, with only significant differences in usage for lesson material creation (Kruskal-Wallis p = 1.1e-2), reflecting a strongly supported difference between university and high school level educators (p = 0.0066; Supplemental Table 3; Figure 4B). Results of a PERMANOVA and ANOSIM additionally indicated that the composition of usage tasks did not differ significantly between educational levels (PERMANOVA | F = 0.593, p = 0.90; ANOSIM | R = -0.035, p = 0.86 ).";"Post hoc pairwise comparisons using Dunn’s test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction revealed significant differences between the United States and Macau (Z = −3.16, p = 0.0095), as well as between the United States and Germany (Z = 2.60, p = 0.028 

Ordinal logistic regression analyses indicated no significant association between GenAI familiarity and either age (p = 0.76) or years of teaching experience (p = 0.74; Supplemental Figures 2 and 3) 

Teachers working in high schools, universities, or at multiple educational levels were significantly more likely to use GenAI compared to middle school teachers (0.002 &lt; p &lt; 0.023) 

Visualization of perceptions of GenAI accessibility between respondents revealed further disparities between countries also indicated by a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (chi-squared = 12.7; p = 0.005) 

Post hoc pairwise comparisons using Dunn’s test with BenjaminiHochberg correction revealed significant differences between the United States and Macau (Z=−2.95, p = 0.019), as well as between Colombia and Macau (Z = -3.33, p = 0.005) 

Further NMDS visualization highlighted distinct patterns of dissimilarity between countries, with Colombian respondents exhibiting a notably narrower spread of scores compared to other countries (Supplemental Figure 5). This variance within groups resulted in shifts of the centroids (average positions) for each country that were statistically significant in a PERMANOVA (F = 11.141, p = 0.001) 

Visualization of NMDS revealed significant shifts in the variability of responses between educational levels of instruction (PERMANOVA F = 2.97, p = 0.01), with universitylevel instructors exhibiting the most consistent self-reported scoring patterns (Supplemental Figure 6) 

Multiple comparison adjusted pairwise PERMANOVA results further identified significant disparities between middle school and both university (p = 0.01) and high school respondents (p = 0.001), as well as significant differences between primary/elementary school and high school respondents (p = 0.004) 

Analysis of usage patterns across task categories (assessment and feedback, differentiation and personalization, and lesson material creation) revealed disparities between countries (Supplemental Figure 7) that were also reflected in significant differences in usage scores for each task category ( Kruskal-Wallis: assessment and feedback: p = 4.5e-8; differentiation and personalization: p = 1.25e-2; lesson material creation: p = 1.36e-15), with significant differences for the majority of country-task combinations (Table 1) 

Results of a PERMANOVA additionally indicated that the composition of usage tasks differs significantly across countries (F = 5.5, p = 0.001), with an ANOSIM supporting differences between countries as greater than those within (R = 0.079, p = 0.009) 

Of the respondents using GenAI in the classroom, there was not a strong signature of usage patterns across task categories varying by level of instruction, with only significant differences in usage for lesson material creation (Kruskal-Wallis p = 1.1e-2), reflecting a strongly supported difference between university and high school level educators (p = 0.0066; Supplemental Table 3; Figure 4B) 

Over 30% of German respondents indicated that they had not yet learned about integrating GenAI into the classroom 

Approximately 60% of university instructors indicated learning through experimentation, a level three times higher than the approximately 20% of elementary educators reporting the same 

But the only detectable significant difference emerged in professional development related to lesson material creation between respondents from the United States and Colombia (Kruskal-Wallis test: p = 0.0035) 

This disparity was driven by a slight but significant increase in scores for Colombian respondents compared to those from the United States (Dunn’s test: p = 0.0027; Supplemental Table 4; Supplemental Figure 11), meaning that the Colombian teachers were more likely to have received PD on how GenAI can be used for material creation 

When evaluating the relationship between professional development and GenAI usage, training in specific categories (e.g., Lesson Material Creation) was generally significantly correlated with usage in the same category (Supplemental Figure 13, Table 2) 

A recent survey in Norway found that over 60% of respondents reported little to no understanding of AI algorithms and their applications, underscoring the persistent gaps in awareness that hinder engagement (Gran et al, 2021)";"Respondents from the United States and Colombia demonstrated higher levels of familiarity and usage, with accessibility and self-reported knowledge in foundational GenAI concepts significantly outpacing those reported by educators in Germany and Macau 

These contrasts were further reflected in usage patterns, where Colombian and U.S respondents engaged more frequently in GenAI-supported tasks such as lesson material creation or assessment 

University-level and high school/secondary educators reported far greater participation in workshops and experimentation with GenAI compared to other levels of instruction 

Training in specific task categories, such as assessment and feedback or differentiation, showed strong correlations with usage in those areas, reinforcing the pivotal role of professional development in facilitating GenAI adoption (Brandão et al, 2024; Moorhouse et al, 2024; Zhai, 2024). These findings highlight a heterogeneous landscape driven by the compatibility of GenAI with established teaching practices, the perceived complexity of integrating these tools, and disparities in institutional and policy support (Rogers, 2003) 

The past year has witnessed an explosion of studies and reviews providing insights into pathways and strategies that facilitate the adoption of GenAI tools among teachers (Aljemely, 2024; Chiu et al, 2023; Chounta et al, 2022; Dornburg &amp; Davin, 2024; Kim et al, 2022; Moorhouse et al, 2024) 

A comprehensive strategy for institutional support is critical for bridging these gaps, with UNESCO recently putting forth recommendations for governmental policies and initiatives that can support the use of AI tools by teachers (Miao et al, 2021) 

These UNESCO recommendations underscore the importance of institutional support through guidance and development programs that accommodate the diverse needs of educators across all educational levels, as comprehensive training significantly enhances AI literacy and equitable adoption in education (Chauncey &amp; McKenna, 2023; Ding et al, 2024; Semwaiko et al, 2024) 

While our sample sizes are a small sample of the L2 teacher population, our results align with theoretical expectations posited by Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) (Ghimire &amp; Edwards, 2024), which emphasizes the role of perceived relative advantage (Abdalla et al, 2024), compatibility 

60% of university instructors indicated learning through experimentation, a level three times higher than the approximately 20% of elementary educators reporting the same 

Our findings suggest that targeted institutional interventions—such as professional development programs tailored to diverse educational levels—will be pivotal for fostering equitable and effective integration of GenAI tools into global education systems";By examining the adoption of GenAI tools among L2 teachers in the United States, Colombia, Germany, and Macau, we aim to address this gap and provide insights into the evolving landscape of AI integration in education. 2;"Reference Index

This study examined the influence of a case-based AI professional development (PD) program on AI integration strategies and AI literacy among seven middle school science teachers. Employing three distinct case problems, from well-structured to ill-structured, the AI PD program aimed to stimulate teachers' reflection on AI literacy development and encourage the construction of problem-solving and AI integration strategies within various pedagogical contexts. Analysis of video-recorded case discussions revealed that teachers primarily drew on personal experiences for collaborative problem-solving across the three cases. However, the complexity of the case problems influenced their approach to knowledge co-construction, and dealing with ill-structured problems promoted the application of new knowledge. Through analyzing the survey data, we found a marked increase in teachers' AI literacy, particularly in the domain of knowing and understanding AI, suggesting a pivotal role for direct instruction that supports AI literacy growth. However, their application of this AI knowledge was limited during the case discussions, while other domains of teacher AI literacy were more frequently employed. The findings highlight the importance of combining direct instruction with case-based discussions in AI-related PD programs to bolster teacher AI literacy effectively.

journal-article;School librarians developing AI literacy for an AI-driven future: leveraging the AI Citizenship Framework with scope and sequence;Zakir Hossain;Library Hi Tech News;2024;10.1108/lhtn-10-2024-0186;Purpose The purpose of this paper is to introduce the artificial intelligence (AI) Citizenship Framework, a model that equips teachers and school library professionals with the tools to develop AI literacy and citizenship in students. As AI becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to prepare students for an AI-driven future. The framework aims to foster foundational knowledge of AI, critical thinking and ethical decision-making, empowering students to engage responsibly with AI technologies. By providing a structured approach to AI literacy, the framework helps educators integrate AI concepts into their lessons, ensuring students develop the skills needed to navigate and contribute to an AI-driven society. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a theoretical framework, developed from the author’s experience as an information and digital literacy coach and teacher librarian across Asia, the Middle East and Europe. The AI Citizenship Framework was created without following specific empirical methodologies, drawing instead on practical insights and educational needs observed in diverse contexts. It outlines a scope and sequence for integrating AI literacy into school curricula. The framework’s components build on existing pedagogical practices while emphasising critical, ethical and responsible AI engagement. By providing a structure for AI education, it serves as a practical resource for school librarians and educators. Findings While no empirical data was collected for this theoretical paper, the AI Citizenship Framework offers a structured approach for school librarians and educators to introduce and develop AI literacy. It has the potential to influence AI education by fostering critical and ethical awareness among students, empowering them to participate responsibly in an AI-driven world. The framework’s practical application can be expanded beyond school librarians to include classroom teachers, offering a comprehensive model adaptable to various educational settings. Its real-world implementation could enhance students’ readiness to engage with AI technologies, providing long-term benefits for both educational institutions and the broader society. Research limitations/implications One limitation of the AI Citizenship Framework is that it has not yet been empirically validated. Future research could focus on testing its practical effectiveness in real-world settings, offering insights that may inform refinements and adaptations to better support school librarians and educators in fostering AI literacy and AI citizenship. Practical implications The practical implication of the AI Citizenship Framework is its application in educational settings to equip students with AI literacy and responsible citizenship skills. School library professionals and teachers can use the framework to integrate AI concepts into curricula, fostering critical thinking, ethical understanding and informed decision-making about AI technologies. The framework provides ready-to-use curriculum plans, enabling educators to prepare students for an AI-driven world. Its adaptability also allows classroom teachers to lead AI literacy initiatives, making it a versatile tool for embedding AI education across subjects and promoting responsible use and engagement with AI technologies in real-world contexts. Originality/value The originality and value of the AI Citizenship Framework lie in its approach to integrate AI literacy into educational contexts, specifically tailored for teacher librarians and school librarians. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first framework that comprehensively addresses the need for AI literacy from an ethical, critical and societal perspective, while also promoting active participation and leadership in AI governance. The framework equips educators with practical tools and curriculum plans, fostering responsible AI use and engagement. Its adaptable structure ensures it can be implemented by classroom teachers as well, adding significant value to AI education across disciplines and age groups.;AI literacy;Artificial intelligence;Generative AI;real world;K-12;;;"This study argues that teacher librarians/school librarians and educators need a framework for integrating artificial intelligence literacy into information/digital literacy, where the latter is viewed as interdisciplinary literacy

AI has impacted school librarianship too, and it will continue to do so (Softlink Education, 2024). In this new role of educating and promoting AI literacy, school librarians/teacher librarians – the guardians of information integrity – are well-suited (Bauld, 2023; Oddone et al, 2024; Seith, 2024) because they are well-versed in the concepts of teaching, promoting and fostering information literacy, digital literacy, media literacy, academic integrity and copyright literacy (Hossain et al, 2024b; Merga, 2022)

Karaca et al (2021) and Markauskaite et al (2022) introduced the notions of “AI readiness” and “AI capabilities”, respectively. While school or university courses are the main source of information for learning about AI, Hossain et al (2024a) reported that the low percentage of students receiving formal education on AI indicates a lack of structured learning opportunities, echoing concerns that Luckin et al (2022) and Limna et al (2022) raised regarding the inconsistent integration of AI topics in educational settings. It is therefore important for students to develop a sustainable, interdisciplinary and trasferable AI skill set that prepares them to use and interact with AI and GenAI tools and applications productively and ethically in various settings, be they personal, educational or professional. Likewise, governments, researchers and education leaders must consider how to prepare a diverse citizenry to thrive in the coming age of AI.;;"Concluding remarks The AI Citizenship Framework provides a comprehensive approach to preparing individuals for an AI-driven future by fostering AI literacy, ethical engagement and AI citizenship

The paper aims at introducing the idea of contextualizing AI education and learning experience of K-12 students with examples and tips using the work-in-progress version of the contextualized curriculum using culturally responsive approaches to promote the awareness and understanding of AI ethics among middle school students.;middle school student;robotics;artificial intelligence;everyday life;Contextualization;;;"This paper focuses on one of the 5 Big Ideas in artificial intelligence - Societal Impact and our attempt to adapt “An Ethics of Artificial Intelligence Curriculum for Middle School Students”, AI curriculum focusing on AI ethics developed by Blakeley H 

It was two decades ago, Hendler [25] expressed his observation about robotics evolution:";About 70% of teachers felt uncertain about the implementation or not ready to implement computer science education in their classrooms;"This paper focuses on one of the 5 Big Ideas in AI - Societal Impact and our attempt to adapt “An Ethics of Artificial Intelligence Curriculum for Middle School Students”, AI curriculum focusing on AI ethics developed by Blakeley H 

Eglash et al introduced an example of a student from Tanzania studying at the University of Finland not understanding programming examples that referenced European games of chance to explain that culturally responsive pedagogy can be incorporated anywhere to benefit students who do not come from the group that created the curriculum 

Introducing AI literacy to diverse learners successfully requires making AI and its concepts relevant and relatable by using culturally responsive pedagogy. This approach helps students see the connection between AI and what they are interested in and familiar with, as African-American students could between hip-hop and computing education, which will deeply engage them in the new learning experience. It was two decades ago, Hendler [25] expressed his observation about robotics evolution: A funny thing is happening in the field of robotics 

The robotics journals and conferences have largely missed the fact that robots are starting to leave the laboratory and make it out into the world. (p. 2) 

This is happening with AI as technological-tools and content for learning from possibly pre-kindergarten to post-secondary students 

The degree and types of AI integration in society varies from country to country, or culture to culture 

It introduced how AI has been integrated in and influenced our lives, and how the issues around introducing AI in K-12 education in various countries have been addressed 

It, discussed how the integration of AI literacy in education is lagged behind in Japan, which has just laid out its computer science education
