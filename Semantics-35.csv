When engaging in professional development, curricula are treated as set in stone, static and educators are prepared to offer the curriculum as written instead of empowered to be leaders in efforts to spread and sustain AI education. This limits the degree to which teachers tailor new curricula to student needs and interests, ultimately distancing students from new and potentially relevant content. This paper describes an AI Educator Make-a-Thon, a two-day gathering of 34 educators from across the United States that centered co-design of AI literacy materials as the culminating experience of a year-long professional development program called Everyday AI (EdAI) in which educators studied and practiced implementing an innovative curriculum for Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) in their classrooms. Inspired by the energizing and empowering experiences of Hack-a-Thons, the Make-a-Thon was designed to increase the depth and longevity of the educators' investment in AI education by positively impacting their sense of belonging to the AI community, AI content knowledge, and their self confidence as AI curriculum designers.

It aims to not only raise children’s awareness of filter bubbles but also empower them to mitigate this ethical issue through sense-making of AI recommendation systems’ inner workings. By having children experience and break filter bubbles in a flower recommendation system, BeeTrap utilizes embodied metaphors (e.g., NEAR-FAR, ITERATION) and analogies (bee pollination) to bridge abstract AI concepts with sensory-motor experiences in familiar STEM contexts. To evaluate our design’s effectiveness and accessibility for a broad range of children, we introduced BeeTrap in a four-day summer camp for middle-school students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM. Results from pre- and post-tests and interviews show that BeeTrap developed students’ technical understanding of AI recommendations, empowered them to break filter bubbles, and helped them foster new personal and societal perspectives around AI technologies.","",""

Previous research in AI education materials has largely focused on the introduction of terminology as well as AI use cases and ethics, but few allow students to learn by creating their own machine learning models. Therefore, there is a need for enriching AI educational tools with more adaptable and flexible platforms for interested educators with any level of technical experience to utilize within their teaching material. As such, we propose the development of an open-source tool (Build-A-Bot) for students and teachers to not only create their own transformer-based chatbots based on their own course material but also learn the fundamentals of AI through the model creation process. The primary concern of this paper is the creation of an interface for students to learn the principles of artificial intelligence by using a natural language pipeline to train a customized model to answer questions based on their own school curriculums. The model uses contexts given by their instructor, such as chapters of a textbook, to answer questions and is deployed on an interactive chatbot/voice agent. The pipeline teaches students data collection, data augmentation, intent recognition, and question answering by having them work through each of these processes while creating their AI agent, diverging from previous chatbot work where students and teachers use the bots as black-boxes with no abilities for customization or the bots lack AI capabilities, with the majority of dialogue scripts being rule-based. In addition, our tool is designed to make each step of this pipeline intuitive for students at a middle-school level. Further work primarily lies in providing our tool to schools and seeking student and teacher evaluations.","http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07542",""

This article outlines three strategies implemented for multilingual middle school students during a summer camp in Southern California. We argue for a mutually beneficial relationship between acquiring second language proficiency and AI literacy. Supporting these processes, we present three pedagogical strategies: (1) storytelling to model AI decision-making, (2) role-playing as an AI to demonstrate programmability and learning from data, and (3) programming text-to-speech-to-text AI to illustrate sensor functionality and action-reaction concepts. Additionally, we discuss their alignment with AI competencies. These strategies potentially foster linguistic scaffolding and translanguaging, aiding multilingual learners in acquiring new literacies.","https://escholarship.org/content/qt4mq8c886/qt4mq8c886.pdf",""

Methods Based on a literature review of AI literacy, this study extracted AI-related components from the “Elementary and Middle School Artificial Intelligence Education Content Standards” developed by the Ministry of Education. Subsequently, AI content elements relevant to music were identified and selected, and corresponding performance expectations for elementary and middle school levels were formulated. These content elements and performance expectations were categorized into principles and applications, aligned with the three domains of AI literacy: understanding, applying, and critiquing. Results In the “Understanding” domain, participants grasped principles related to ‘Collection and Exploration of Music Data’ and ‘Visualization and Prediction of Music Data,’ which were then applied to activities fostering an understanding of ‘Music Elements and Characteristics through AI Utilization.’ Within the “Applying” domain, principles grounded in ‘AI Advancements and Diverse Musical Applications’ were employed for activities involving ‘Performance, Creation, and Appreciation through AI-Driven Music Engagement.’ In the “Critiquing” domain, principles concerning ‘Understanding Bias and Promoting Diversity in Music Data’ and ‘Ethics and Responsible Usage of AI in Music’ were identified. This section further encapsulates content elements and performance expectations that can be utilized to comprehend broader aspects of life and careers coexisting with AI in music, extending to the ‘Copyright and Artistic Value of AI-Generated Music Works.’ Conclusions The AI literacy-enriched music content elements and performance expectations developed in this study are expected to offer insights into the future direction of curriculum development and instructional strategies within the context of AI education. These contributions are anticipated to guide the implementation of music curricula that can effectively integrate with the evolving AI education landscape, shaping the trajectory of teaching and learning.","",""

Also, this study utilized a quantitative-correlational design with 335 participants among Junior High School and Senior High School students in Lorenzo S. Sarmiento Sr. National High School. The average weighted mean, Pearson R, and multiple regression analysis were the statistical tools used in this study. Along with this, the results showed a high level of artificial intelligence (AI) usage in terms of satisfaction, AI literacy, relevance of AI, and confidence. Likewise, results showed a high level of students’ academic writing in terms of usefulness, ease of use, and attitude towards usage. In addition, there was a high correlation, and a significant relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) usage and its influence on the students’ academic writing. Hence, this led to the rejection of the null hypothesis. The domains of artificial intelligence (AI) usage that influenced students’ academic writing are the relevance of AI, confidence, and AI literacy. While satisfaction, as a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) usage, had no significant influence on students’ academic writing. Thus, educational institutions could harness the positive influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on students’ academic writing, creating a more technologically advanced, collaborative, and effective learning environment while encouraging students to participate in AI-assisted activities contributing to better progress and improved self-regulated learning as they interacted with AI tools and their peers in an academic setting.","",""
