The sample for this study consisted of 20 first-year middle-school students who participated in theme selection activities in a free semester program as part of their home economics studies. The data for the study consisted of nine class observation logs, four group activity outputs, 30 class results, an online survey, and in-depth interviews with three students. A program called “R.U.OK” was developed by setting problematic situation for school violence prevention linked to the contents of the Home Economics Education(HEE) curriculum. After the program was implemented, the survey on the students’ class satisfaction content elements, with AI-based learning activities and PBL and interest, displayed high points, with an average of 4.0 or higher. Our qualitative analysis produced four significant results. First, students’ concerns about school violence had increased and they showed a change in attitude, having more empathy with friends and more interest in their surroundings. Second, digital and AI literacy had improved, and students’ interest in digital media learning had increased. Third, there had been an improvement in problem-solving ability in terms of being able to think more critically and independently. Fourth, the results also demonstrated that there had been a positive effect on self-direction and an improved capacity for teamwork. This study was significant in demonstrating the effectiveness of a program for the prevention of school violence based on the use of digital technology in the educational environment.</jats:p>",61,1,15,28,Curriculum; Teamwork; Empathy; Psychology; Mathematics education; Class (philosophy); Medical education; Pedagogy; Social psychology; Medicine; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Political science; Law,,,,,http://her.re.kr/upload/pdf/her-61-1-15.pdf https://doi.org/10.6115/her.2023.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.6115/her.2023.002,,10.6115/her.2023.002,,,0,021-942-731-472-652; 029-863-669-255-571; 056-583-178-402-816; 067-298-580-764-029; 068-087-645-164-320; 077-148-600-848-473; 112-203-532-506-40X; 125-384-038-213-166; 183-952-650-964-173,2,true,,bronze

013-520-320-594-292,Design and Teaching Strategies for Artificial Intelligence Convergence Education to Protect Creative Autonomy: Focusing on the Middle School Art Class,2024-03-31,2024,journal article,Korean Association For Learner-Centered Curriculum And Instruction,15982106; 2671776x,Korean Association For Learner-Centered Curriculum And Instruction,,Yoorim Son; Juhyun Kim; Kyunga Ji,"<jats:p>Objectives This study has developed teaching strategies that instructors can use to design and implement artificial intelligence convergence education utilizing generative artificial intelligence for image creation. The derived lesson designs and teaching strategies suggest a limited use of artificial intelligence to ensure that learners using generative AI do not lose their creative autonomy.; Methods Through a review of prior literature, an initial checklist for class design and a teaching strategy were developed. Subsequently, two rounds of internal validation were conducted with four experts. A creative class utilizing image-generating artificial intelligence was then implemented for 100 first-year middle school students in Seoul. The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated through pre- and post-tests of artificial intelligence literacy and interviews with the learners.; Results Ultimately, 10 items for the class design checklist and 51 items for the teaching strategy were developed. The class design checklist included steps for ‘checking the usage environment’, ‘evaluating the class content’, and ‘assessing expertise’. The teaching strategy was structured into stages of ‘class preparation’, ‘understanding image-generating artificial intelligence’, ‘creative problem-solving’, and ‘class arrangement’. As a result of implementing these creative classes with image-generating artificial intelligence, there was a significant improvement in the students’ artificial intelligence literacy. Furthermore, both instructors and learners highlighted several benefits of these classes, such as the integration of artificial intelligence with various subjects, the enhancement of divergent thinking, firsthand experience with artificial intelligence principles and applications, opportunities for collaboration and discussion, and a strengthened understanding of copyright and ethical considerations.; Conclusions The instructional class design checklist and teaching strategy developed in this study serve as cross-curricular guidelines applicable to various subjects that involve image creation, including Korean language, history, and art. Designing artificial intelligence convergence lessons with a focus on protecting learner’s creative autonomy can enable them to grasp the entire creative process and its inherent value. This approach goes beyond mere technical use, empowering learners to enhance their own creative expressions.; </jats:p>",24,6,311,331,Autonomy; Convergence (economics); Class (philosophy); Mathematics education; Middle class; Pedagogy; Psychology; Computer science; Sociology; Artificial intelligence; Political science; Law; Economics; Economic growth,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.22251/jlcci.2024.24.6.311,,10.22251/jlcci.2024.24.6.311,,,0,,0,false,,

To achieve this objective, a 10-session AI-consumer life integration education program was developed by analyzing literature on AI Literacy, AI curriculum, consumer education, and the home economics curriculum for the middle school consumer life area. The program’s validity was assessed by nine teachers using a four-point Likert scale. The average scores for each item and the content validity index (CVI) were calculated. Based on expert feedback, the program was revised and improved accordingly. The expert validity assessment of the lesson plans, teaching materials and learning resources resulted in an average score of 3.78 for all items and an average CVI of 0.96. For the overall program, the expert validity assessment yielded an average score of 3.72 for all items and an average CVI of 0.97. Since the content validity index for all questions was above 0.78, the program demonstrated high validity across achievement standards integration, learning objectives, content and teaching methods, motivation, and volume areas. This confirms its effectiveness as an educational program for enhancing AI literacy. This study is significant in terms of defining and identifying the components of AI literacy, developing an AI-integrated program encompassing the entire consumer life area and confirming the suitability of the home economics curriculum for enhancing digital consumer competencies and promoting sustainable consumption. Additionally, it highlights the potential to integrate AI into the home economics and consumer life area.</jats:p>",62,3,517,530,Curriculum; Content validity; Likert scale; Literacy; Index (typography); Scale (ratio); Economics education; Psychology; Mathematics education; Medical education; Computer science; Pedagogy; Primary education; Psychometrics; Medicine; Clinical psychology; Developmental psychology; Physics; Quantum mechanics; World Wide Web,,,,,http://her.re.kr/upload/pdf/her-62-3-517.pdf https://doi.org/10.6115/her.2024.036,http://dx.doi.org/10.6115/her.2024.036,,10.6115/her.2024.036,,,0,005-563-459-585-93X; 035-242-082-736-742; 076-061-637-954-001; 089-765-289-046-150; 100-190-966-889-158; 122-189-815-489-034,0,true,,bronze

There is a knowledge gap in how to prepare teachers to teach AI literacy in inclusive classrooms and how teacher-led classroom implementations can impact students. This paper reports a comparison study to investigate the effectiveness of an AI literacy curriculum when taught by classroom teachers. The experimental group included 89 middle school students who learned an AI literacy curriculum during regular school hours. The comparison group consisted of 69 students who did not learn the curriculum. Both groups completed the same pre and post-test. The results show that students in the experimental group developed a deeper understanding of AI concepts and more positive attitudes toward AI and its impact on future careers after the curriculum than those in the comparison group. This shows that the teacher-led classroom implementation successfully equipped students with a conceptual understanding of AI. Students achieved significant gains in recognizing how AI is relevant to their lives and felt empowered to thrive in the age of AI. Overall this study confirms the potential of preparing K-12 classroom teachers to offer AI education in classrooms in order to reach learners of diverse backgrounds and broaden participation in AI literacy education among young learners.</jats:p>",38,21,23318,23325,Curriculum; Mathematics education; Literacy; Computer science; Pedagogy; Psychology; Medical education; Medicine,,,,,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/30380/32443 https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i21.30380,http://dx.doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i21.30380,,10.1609/aaai.v38i21.30380,,,0,,1,true,,gold

We conducted nine focus groups with 24 middle school students to elicit their interests, conceptions of, and approaches to a popular generative AI tool, ChatGPT. We highlight a) personally and culturally-relevant topics to this population, b) three distinct approaches in students' open-ended interactions with ChatGPT: AI testing-oriented, AI socializing-oriented, and content exploring-oriented, and 3) an improved understanding of youths' conceptions and misconceptions of generative AI. While misconceptions highlight gaps in understanding what generative AI is and how it works, most learners show interest in learning about what AI is and what it can do.

Clamares; Anna Marie O. Pelandas,"This study dealt with the artificial intelligence (AI) usage and its influence on students’ academic writing. The primary goal of the study was to determine the level of artificial intelligence (AI) usage and students’ academic writing in terms of their respective indicators, the significant difference between artificial intelligence (AI) usage and students’, and what domains of artificial intelligence (AI) substantially influenced students’ academic writing. Also, this study utilized a quantitative-correlational design with 335 participants among Junior High School and Senior High School students in Lorenzo S. Sarmiento Sr. National High School. The average weighted mean, Pearson R, and multiple regression analysis were the statistical tools used in this study. Along with this, the results showed a high level of artificial intelligence (AI) usage in terms of satisfaction, AI literacy, relevance of AI, and confidence. Likewise, results showed a high level of students’ academic writing in terms of usefulness, ease of use, and attitude towards usage. In addition, there was a high correlation, and a significant relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) usage and its influence on the students’ academic writing. Hence, this led to the rejection of the null hypothesis. The domains of artificial intelligence (AI) usage that influenced students’ academic writing are the relevance of AI, confidence, and AI literacy. While satisfaction, as a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) usage, had no significant influence on students’ academic writing. Thus, educational institutions could harness the positive influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on students’ academic writing, creating a more technologically advanced, collaborative, and effective learning environment while encouraging students to participate in AI-assisted activities contributing to better progress and improved self-regulated learning as they interacted with AI tools and their peers in an academic setting.",VIII,IV,1621,1627,Correlation; Mathematics education; Psychology; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Mathematics; Geometry,,,,,,,,,,,0,,0,false,,
068-780-292-318-106,What are artificial intelligence literacy and competency? A comprehensive framework to support them,,2024,journal article,Computers and Education Open,26665573,Elsevier BV,,Thomas K.F. Chiu; Zubair Ahmad; Murod Ismailov; Ismaila Temitayo Sanusi,"Artificial intelligence (AI) education in K–12 schools is a global initiative, yet planning and executing AI education is challenging. The major frameworks are focused on identifying content and technical knowledge (AI literacy). Most of the current definitions of AI literacy for a non-technical audience are developed from an engineering perspective and may not be appropriate for K–12 education. Teacher perspectives are essential to making sense of this initiative. Literacy is about knowing (knowledge, what skills); competency is about applying the knowledge in a beneficial way (confidence, how well). They are strongly related. This study goes beyond knowledge (AI literacy), and its two main goals are to (i) define AI literacy and competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self-reflective mindsets, and (ii) propose a more comprehensive framework for K–12 AI education. These definitions are needed for this emerging and disruptive technology (e.g., ChatGPT and Sora, generative AI). We used the definitions and the basic curriculum design approaches as the analytical framework and teacher perspectives. Participants included 30 experienced AI teachers from 15 middle schools. We employed an iterative co-design cycle to discuss and revise the framework throughout four cycles. The definition of AI competency has five abilities that take confidence into account, and the proposed framework comprises five key components: technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self-reflection. We also identify five effective learning experiences to foster abilities and confidences, and suggest five future research directions: prompt engineering, data literacy, algorithmic literacy, self-reflective mindset, and empirical research.",6,,100171,100171,Mindset; Literacy; Curriculum; Computer science; Information literacy; Mathematics education; Psychology; Knowledge management; Pedagogy; Artificial intelligence,,,,University Grants Committee Research Grants Council,http://qspace.qu.edu.qa/bitstream/10576/55957/1/1-s2.0-S2666557324000120-main%20%282%29.pdf http://hdl.handle.net/10576/55957,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100171,,10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100171,,,0,007-014-190-707-420; 009-803-178-043-363; 009-884-658-822-013; 012-730-047-111-956; 035-847-956-566-556; 037-565-575-599-319; 041-890-828-763-820; 044-894-482-018-096; 045-322-155-338-933; 047-438-434-093-200; 059-734-784-895-096; 064-948-517-429-482; 065-830-208-828-060; 068-992-303-641-342; 083-449-940-348-930; 086-576-199-859-009; 094-993-620-528-631; 096-862-572-537-949; 104-075-080-650-780; 110-338-606-909-208; 123-270-004-499-225; 130-656-093-027-873; 136-741-711-005-458; 141-916-006-014-781; 146-424-407-870-766; 151-265-109-014-246; 154-083-866-770-489; 159-046-550-244-828; 168-130-020-626-587; 182-317-637-268-115; 182-624-527-686-981; 190-592-564-643-741; 191-523-142-285-988; 191-651-294-139-484; 194-641-419-006-328,25,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Looking towards the near future, jobs will largely be related to AI. In this context literacy in AI and computer science will become as important as classic literacy (reading/writing). By using an analogy with this process we developed a novel AI education concept aiming at fostering AI literacy. The concept comprises modules for different age groups on different educational levels. Fundamental AI/computer science topics addressed in each module are, amongst others, problem solving by search, sorting, graphs and data structures. We developed, conducted and evaluated four proof-of-concepts modules focusing on kindergarten/primary school as well as middle school, high school and university.

For teachers, how to skillfully apply AI in teaching and improve their AI literacy has become a necessary goal for their sustainable professional development. This research examines the correlations among the dimensions of AI literacy of teachers in order to promote the effectiveness of class teaching and the adoption of artificial intelligence literacy (AIL). Our findings are based on the analysis of 1013 survey results, where we tested the level of AI literacy of teachers, including Knowing and Understanding AI (KUAI), Applying AI (AAI), Evaluating AI Application (EAIA), and AI Ethics (AIE). We find that AAI had a significant, positive effect on the other three dimensions. Thus, based on the analysis, the government should take action to cultivate teachers’ AI literacy. In order to improve teachers’ AI literacy, the choice of curriculum, content, methods, and practical resources for special training should be diverse and committed to making AI literacy an essential enabler for teachers’ sustainable future development.</jats:p>",14,21,14549,14549,Literacy; Government (linguistics); Mathematics education; Curriculum; Enabling; China; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Pedagogy; Political science; Linguistics; Philosophy; Law; Psychotherapist,,,,China Children’s Center Children’s Artificial Intelligence Education Institute,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/21/14549/pdf?version=1667901744 https://doi.org/10.3390/su142114549,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142114549,,10.3390/su142114549,,,0,000-271-752-647-574; 000-517-268-078-629; 001-941-812-220-705; 003-852-536-995-384; 008-746-504-196-708; 010-500-720-569-830; 012-373-299-723-243; 012-730-047-111-956; 016-738-422-811-869; 019-459-647-340-997; 019-675-899-446-233; 021-343-119-005-113; 026-193-036-926-524; 028-702-069-138-546; 030-154-869-163-43X; 043-993-741-888-705; 044-055-708-723-904; 044-194-084-160-41X; 044-811-366-061-867; 045-471-634-173-143; 047-855-839-483-693; 049-250-890-113-656; 050-924-197-842-192; 055-533-229-813-921; 059-211-656-008-779; 059-931-415-965-469; 064-811-520-753-841; 066-057-377-841-697; 072-878-120-382-283; 076-886-150-308-16X; 080-532-640-017-505; 081-463-143-697-415; 084-421-409-288-330; 085-748-558-949-746; 086-049-491-145-623; 086-989-145-916-069; 093-190-306-880-914; 094-945-737-281-939; 098-075-989-438-612; 099-478-751-609-12X; 104-422-103-356-749; 116-953-447-460-185; 123-270-004-499-225; 125-460-939-653-873; 131-351-117-172-178; 136-741-711-005-458; 139-188-660-265-521; 147-476-522-574-47X; 147-476-583-444-599; 151-251-763-378-653; 157-429-904-751-268; 162-695-814-447-011; 163-161-512-986-853; 188-607-527-971-68X; 190-149-121-104-013,44,true,,gold

However, many developing countries lack the basic infrastructure needed for taking advantage of AI systems, which could worsen the new technological, economic, and social divides. Ensuring the inclusion and equity of AI in education is one of the challenges that we need to solve. How can we support the urgent needs of developing countries and the underprivileged communities so that the divide between “haves” and “have-nots” will not continue to grow? This is the core question that this project is trying to address. This paper introduces the AI-robotics project focusing on developing an open-source affordable AI-robotics tool to address the need to promote AI literacy around the world. CogBots, the AI-empowered educational learning tool, has been in development collaboratively with Google, CogLabs and UNESCO. The project targets upper elementary and middle school students to promote AI literacy, including the 5 Big Ideas in AI, using the AI-powered educational robotics tool and the Teachable Machine by Google Creative Lab providing a machine learning experience.",,,75,85,Sociology; Artificial intelligence; Inclusion (education); Domain (software engineering); Educational robotics; Equity (finance); Ai systems; Robotics; Literacy; Engineering ethics; Developing country,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77022-8_7 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-77022-8_7.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77022-8_7,,10.1007/978-3-030-77022-8_7,3161136262,,0,015-290-736-525-25X; 058-175-182-970-373; 059-027-199-941-853; 127-872-847-838-209,2,false,,

The model prototype's purpose and theoretical foundation were established, validated for internal consistency by five experts in educational technology and English education. The prototype was tested with one English teacher and approximately 48 students over a two-week period in December 2023, refining its content for the final model.; Results To achieve this, 31 first-year middle school students in Seoul were assessed through pre- and post-tests to measure their attitudes toward artificial intelligence literacy and English writing. The final class model consisted of seven stages, distinguishing between learner, instructor, and Generative AI roles. Nine teaching strategies were applied to 39 detailed stages of the class model, aligning with instructional design principles.; Conclusions The developed model holds significance in encouraging students' divergent questioning and proactive learning attitudes through strategic and systematic integration of Generative AI interaction within the English writing class. Moreover, through the development of this class model and teaching strategies, it is anticipated to serve as an effective guideline for educators to design and implement prompt engineering-based Generative AI integrated English writing classes.; </jats:p>",24,6,135,157,Class (philosophy); Literacy; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Mathematics education; Psychology; Pedagogy,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.22251/jlcci.2024.24.6.135,,10.22251/jlcci.2024.24.6.135,,,0,,0,false,,

Consequently, the necessity for an AI ethics education program has become increasingly apparent. This study aims to investigate the influence of an experimental research study that developed and implemented an AI ethics education program for learners’ ethical awareness and attitude towards AI. The research methodology involved validating a model of the AI ethics education program by applying it to a group of 10 domain experts. Additionally, pre-test and post-test designs were employed with 17 middle school students as the experimental group. The same assessment was administered before and after the implementation of the AI ethics education program, and the data were analyzed using paired-sample t-tests. The findings of this study are as follows: Firstly, an AI ethics education program model was developed, incorporating key competencies such as AI literacy, critical thinking skills in AI, and AI problem-solving skills, all within the context of AI ethics. The implementation of this model was effective in the educational setting. Secondly, significant improvements were observed in the ethical awareness of middle school students across all domains after participating in the program. Thirdly, the attitudes of middle school students towards AI exhibited significant enhancements across all domains. These findings contribute to the broader field of AI ethics education by highlighting the importance of ethical awareness in AI and fostering favorable attitudes towards AI. The implications of this study are significant for the field of AI education.</jats:p>",14,4,1588,1588,Perception; Psychology; Test (biology); Context (archaeology); Mathematics education; Pedagogy; Neuroscience; Paleontology; Biology,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/4/1588/pdf?version=1708324162 https://doi.org/10.3390/app14041588,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app14041588,,10.3390/app14041588,,,0,017-563-611-341-995; 029-387-315-649-421; 036-214-271-722-575; 053-071-651-162-128; 064-811-520-753-841; 137-331-098-560-393; 164-216-145-664-386; 195-006-458-799-483,5,true,cc-by,gold

Moore; Safinah Ali; Beatriz Perret; Xiaofei Zhou; Helen Zhang; Irene Lee,"AI curricula are being developed and tested in classrooms, but wider adoption is premised by teacher professional development and buy-in. When engaging in professional development, curricula are treated as set in stone, static and educators are prepared to offer the curriculum as written instead of empowered to be leaders in efforts to spread and sustain AI education. This limits the degree to which teachers tailor new curricula to student needs and interests, ultimately distancing students from new and potentially relevant content. This paper describes an AI Educator Make-a-Thon, a two-day gathering of 34 educators from across the United States that centered co-design of AI literacy materials as the culminating experience of a year-long professional development program called Everyday AI (EdAI) in which educators studied and practiced implementing an innovative curriculum for Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) in their classrooms. Inspired by the energizing and empowering experiences of Hack-a-Thons, the Make-a-Thon was designed to increase the depth and longevity of the educators' investment in AI education by positively impacting their sense of belonging to the AI community, AI content knowledge, and their self confidence as AI curriculum designers. In this paper we describe the Make-a-Thon design, findings, and recommendations for future educator-centered Make-a-Thons.",,,305,311,Curriculum; Professional development; Literacy; Faculty development; Curriculum development; Mathematics education; Pedagogy; Sociology; Computer science; Psychology,,,,National Science Foundation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3545945.3569743 https://doi.org/10.1145/3545945.3569743,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3545945.3569743,,10.1145/3545945.3569743,,,0,013-901-453-017-906; 015-900-507-543-935; 016-751-904-813-329; 019-731-619-510-944; 028-954-300-550-180; 033-823-979-872-856; 043-198-659-521-178; 050-850-125-121-979; 058-543-460-483-134; 064-811-520-753-841; 069-474-387-180-163; 073-557-395-892-345; 077-760-478-694-810; 088-932-117-148-520; 090-012-289-425-416; 122-829-065-732-076; 135-188-961-327-41X,3,true,,bronze

Chiu; Helen Meng; Irwin King; Savio Wai-Ho Wong; Chandni Saxena; Yeung Yam,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) education for K-12 is increasingly important as the emerging AI technologies are pervasively infused into human daily lives. Eleven countries have endorsed and implemented the AI curricula at K-12 levels [1]. The ""Five Big Ideas"" about AI, as proposed by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teacher Association (CSTA) have emerged to form the core components of K-12 AI education [2], [3]. However, the assessment of students' learning in AI education for K-12 is still in its initial stage. Surveys and interviews are the major assessing tools based on students' self- perceptions. Standardized tests on students' AI literacy are still rare. This paper focuses on the first stage of an AI literacy test based on the Five Big Ideas for Grade 7 to Grade 9 students. The test aims to measure the changes of students' AI literacy before and after attending a one-year AI course. The preliminary findings show the students have increased in their AI literacy after attending the course. The test can provide insights for understanding students' competencies and needs in AI literacy and improving the curriculum guidelines for students' effective learning.",,,59,64,Test (biology); Curriculum; Literacy; Mathematics education; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Medical education; Pedagogy; Medicine; Paleontology; Biology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tale54877.2022.00018,,10.1109/tale54877.2022.00018,,,0,016-751-904-813-329; 024-600-134-196-273; 025-075-233-587-193; 045-905-843-601-939; 058-175-182-970-373; 064-811-520-753-841; 079-260-476-625-231; 090-012-289-425-416; 094-945-737-281-939; 099-862-538-016-460; 104-075-080-650-780; 136-134-757-680-454; 149-811-868-385-201; 182-624-527-686-981,4,false,,

The primary goal of the study was to determine the level of artificial intelligence (AI) usage and students’ academic writing in terms of their respective indicators, the significant difference between artificial intelligence (AI) usage and students’, and what domains of artificial intelligence (AI) substantially influenced students’ academic writing. Also, this study utilized a quantitative-correlational design with 335 participants among Junior High School and Senior High School students in Lorenzo S. Sarmiento Sr. National High School. The average weighted mean, Pearson R, and multiple regression analysis were the statistical tools used in this study. Along with this, the results showed a high level of artificial intelligence (AI) usage in terms of satisfaction, AI literacy, relevance of AI, and confidence. Likewise, results showed a high level of students’ academic writing in terms of usefulness, ease of use, and attitude towards usage. In addition, there was a high correlation, and a significant relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) usage and its influence on the students’ academic writing. Hence, this led to the rejection of the null hypothesis. The domains of artificial intelligence (AI) usage that influenced students’ academic writing are the relevance of AI, confidence, and AI literacy. While satisfaction, as a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) usage, had no significant influence on students’ academic writing. Thus, educational institutions could harness the positive influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on students’ academic writing, creating a more technologically advanced, collaborative, and effective learning environment while encouraging students to participate in AI-assisted activities contributing to better progress and improved self-regulated learning as they interacted with AI tools and their peers in an academic setting.</jats:p>",VIII,IV,1621,1627,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2024.804216,,10.47772/ijriss.2024.804216,,,0,,0,false,,

To empower children growing up with AI to navigate society's evolving sociotechnical context, we developed three middle school AI literacy curricula: <i>Creative AI, Dancing with AI,</i> and <i>How to Train Your Robot.</i> In this paper we discuss how we leveraged three design principles-active learning, embedded ethics, and low barriers to access - to effectively engage students in learning to create and critique AI artifacts. During the summer of 2020, we recruited and trained in-service, middle school teachers from across the United States to co-instruct online workshops with students from their schools. In the workshops, a combination of hands-on unplugged and programming activities facilitated students' understanding of AI. As students explored technical concepts in tandem with ethical ones, they developed a critical lens to better grasp how AI systems work and how they impact society. We sought to meet the specified needs of students from a range of backgrounds by minimizing the prerequisite knowledge and technology resources students needed to participate. Finally, we conclude with lessons learned and design recommendations for future AI curricula, especially for K-12 in-person and virtual learning.",33,2,1,383,Curriculum; Context (archaeology); Service-learning; Sociotechnical system; Computer science; Sociology; Pedagogy; Artificial intelligence; Paleontology; Biology,AI Literacy; Artificial Intelligence (AI); Constructionism; Curriculum; Middle-school; Online Learning,,,Amazon Future Engineer; National Science Foundation; LEGO Foundation; Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40593-022-00298-y.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00298-y https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/144260/1/40593_2022_Article_298.pdf https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/144260,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00298-y,35935456,10.1007/s40593-022-00298-y,,PMC9342939,0,000-906-593-639-978; 001-941-812-220-705; 002-243-232-747-656; 006-633-730-485-694; 006-748-813-591-214; 007-407-337-885-609; 008-444-540-655-322; 011-238-035-323-504; 014-275-482-072-550; 023-714-720-106-671; 025-051-032-032-179; 027-224-565-259-806; 029-158-694-008-86X; 032-347-887-782-81X; 032-891-771-564-617; 033-989-325-941-090; 034-302-913-256-009; 035-245-015-930-266; 035-603-945-397-477; 036-833-936-567-876; 041-737-944-200-063; 042-887-900-356-314; 055-118-146-771-027; 055-888-624-273-69X; 058-175-182-970-373; 061-900-019-279-336; 064-811-520-753-841; 066-449-091-205-313; 072-064-213-686-777; 076-826-257-523-375; 077-022-002-419-624; 084-391-924-916-405; 088-932-117-148-520; 092-009-097-939-469; 096-087-138-649-847; 102-749-968-325-986; 106-390-271-856-354; 112-475-988-486-987; 117-109-830-696-185; 120-012-563-544-191; 122-124-026-898-794; 133-298-983-660-787; 144-601-579-620-845; 145-169-523-749-590; 145-977-589-976-222; 167-861-323-159-931,54,true,cc-by,hybrid

Chiu; Yifan Chen; King Woon Yau; Ching-sing Chai; Helen Meng; Irwin King; Savio Wong; Yeung Yam,"The majority of AI literacy studies have designed and developed self-reported questionnaires to assess AI learning and understanding. These studies assessed students' perceived AI capability rather than AI literacy because self-perceptions are seldom an accurate account of true measures. International assessment programs that use objective measures to assess science, mathematical, digital, and computational literacy back up this argument. Furthermore, because AI education research is still in its infancy, the current definition of AI literacy in the literature may not meet the needs of young students. Therefore, this study aims to develop and validate an AI literacy test for school students within the interdisciplinary project known as AI4future. Engineering and education researchers created and selected 25 multiple-choice questions to accomplish this goal, and school teachers validated them while developing an AI curriculum for middle schools. 2,390 students in grades 7 to 9 took the test. We used a Rasch model to investigate the discrimination, reliability, and validity of the items. The results showed that the model met the unidimensionality assumption and demonstrated a set of reliable and valid items. They indicate the quality of the test items.

However, educating young learners to become AI literate citizens poses several challenges. The components of AI literacy are ill-defined and it is unclear to what extent middle school students can engage in learning about AI as a sociotechnical system with socio-political implications. In this paper we posit that students must learn three core domains of AI: technical concepts and processes, ethical and societal implications, and career futures in the AI era. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) workshop that aimed to integrate middle school students' learning of the three domains. We found that after the workshop, most students developed a general understanding of AI concepts and processes (e.g., supervised learning and logic systems). More importantly, they were able to identify bias, describe ways to mitigate bias in machine learning, and start to consider how AI may impact their future lives and careers. At exit, nearly half of the students explained AI as not just a technical subject, but one that has personal, career, and societal implications. Overall, this finding suggests that the approach of incorporating ethics and career futures into AI education is age appropriate and effective for developing AI literacy among middle school students. This study contributes to the field of AI Education by presenting a model of integrating ethics into the teaching of AI that is appropriate for middle school students.",33,2,1,324,Futures contract; Educational technology; Exploratory research; Literacy; Mathematics education; Pedagogy; Sociology; Psychology; Medical education; Engineering ethics; Engineering; Social science; Business; Medicine; Finance,AI ethics; Bias; Career implications; Middle school education; Sociotechnical systems,,,Directorate for Education and Human Resources,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40593-022-00293-3.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00293-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00293-3,35573722,10.1007/s40593-022-00293-3,,PMC9084886,0,001-564-281-856-059; 002-517-856-108-356; 006-979-132-582-388; 007-334-962-851-936; 009-482-262-569-785; 009-938-615-887-600; 010-375-429-763-099; 011-238-035-323-504; 013-758-082-860-945; 013-985-042-873-098; 015-627-999-758-97X; 021-162-400-584-353; 022-870-220-564-789; 023-080-893-237-520; 025-308-080-639-873; 032-347-887-782-81X; 032-891-771-564-617; 033-036-784-854-356; 035-245-015-930-266; 037-298-990-938-37X; 038-152-010-146-225; 046-717-273-365-02X; 050-982-496-453-977; 057-460-424-270-895; 058-175-182-970-373; 064-811-520-753-841; 066-649-756-450-660; 070-682-963-027-389; 071-690-104-381-044; 072-084-655-188-140; 082-898-091-505-379; 090-293-672-276-269; 091-804-712-981-666; 133-298-983-660-787; 140-968-871-531-941; 155-558-681-453-64X; 178-690-675-917-439,107,true,,bronze

The necessity of AI literacy, comprising knowledge and skills for critical interaction with AI, is increasingly important. Multilingual learners, engaging with both every day and domain-specific vocabulary and syntax, must acquire AI literacy, necessitating tailored pedagogical practices. This article outlines three strategies implemented for multilingual middle school students during a summer camp in Southern California. We argue for a mutually beneficial relationship between acquiring second language proficiency and AI literacy. Supporting these processes, we present three pedagogical strategies: (1) storytelling to model AI decision-making, (2) role-playing as an AI to demonstrate programmability and learning from data, and (3) programming text-to-speech-to-text AI to illustrate sensor functionality and action-reaction concepts. Additionally, we discuss their alignment with AI competencies. These strategies potentially foster linguistic scaffolding and translanguaging, aiding multilingual learners in acquiring new literacies.</p>",35,1,,,Storytelling; Literacy; Computer science; Linguistics; Mathematics education; Pedagogy; Sociology; Psychology; Narrative; Philosophy,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5070/b5.35861,,10.5070/b5.35861,,,0,,0,false,,

Applications of, and media generated by generative AI techniques are abundantly present on social media platforms frequented by children, who are not yet aware of the existence of AI-manipulated media. Previous work has highlighted the importance of digital media literacy and AI literacy for children. In this work, we introduce middle school students to generative AI techniques as a tool for creation, while also focusing on critical discussion about their societal and ethical implications, and encouraging pro-activeness in being responsible consumers, creators and stakeholders of technology. We present learning activities that introduce 38 middle-school students to generative modeling, how it is used to generate Deepfakes, cues that help to recognize Deepfakes, and the spread and effects of misinformation. Students demonstrated an understanding that generative media may be believable, but not necessarily true, and can contribute to the spread of misinformation. They were also able to identify why misinformation may be harmful or lasting, drawing specific examples to social settings that indicate human-centered implications. Finally, students expressed opinions about policies surrounding the presence of Deepfakes on social media. This approach can be adopted to introduce students to other technical systems that constitute both productive applications and potential negative implications of technology.

This study examined the influence of a case-based AI professional development (PD) program on AI integration strategies and AI literacy among seven middle school science teachers. Employing three distinct case problems, from well-structured to ill-structured, the AI PD program aimed to stimulate teachers' reflection on AI literacy development and encourage the construction of problem-solving and AI integration strategies within various pedagogical contexts. Analysis of video-recorded case discussions revealed that teachers primarily drew on personal experiences for collaborative problem-solving across the three cases. However, the complexity of the case problems influenced their approach to knowledge co-construction, and dealing with ill-structured problems promoted the application of new knowledge. Through analyzing the survey data, we found a marked increase in teachers' AI literacy, particularly in the domain of knowing and understanding AI, suggesting a pivotal role for direct instruction that supports AI literacy growth. However, their application of this AI knowledge was limited during the case discussions, while other domains of teacher AI literacy were more frequently employed. The findings highlight the importance of combining direct instruction with case-based discussions in AI-related PD programs to bolster teacher AI literacy effectively. The research has implications for using a case-based learning approach during short-term PD initiatives and advocates the ongoing need for comprehensive AI literacy development to facilitate teachers' AI integration in subject-specific teaching.",6,,100178,100178,Literacy; Professional development; Mathematics education; Pedagogy; Psychology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100178,,10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100178,,,0,004-187-588-101-345; 008-059-870-773-89X; 014-699-965-866-08X; 021-717-448-775-374; 022-595-306-930-520; 028-702-069-138-546; 034-271-615-370-234; 038-545-458-385-942; 043-669-063-019-812; 046-189-965-429-630; 056-792-719-330-554; 057-083-768-062-909; 058-960-804-221-136; 059-981-908-715-586; 062-408-819-367-82X; 066-259-209-565-051; 067-105-882-209-115; 068-105-702-980-516; 069-140-437-709-37X; 078-550-710-596-870; 080-471-158-288-298; 082-352-928-584-642; 089-790-612-038-033; 095-148-999-353-407; 095-154-366-628-387; 103-708-287-476-610; 109-116-235-774-877; 113-745-841-805-705; 118-755-417-207-723; 120-838-206-403-930; 131-936-558-568-788; 134-598-018-846-361; 134-935-152-098-522; 155-704-524-233-152; 167-376-798-386-936; 169-270-815-549-782,17,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold
