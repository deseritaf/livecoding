AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop an AI Convergence instructional model to enhance problem formulation competency. To achieve this, we refer to the CT-CPS model developed for SW convergence education, based on the Creative Problem Solving (CPS) model. Additionally, research on problem discovery and understanding, Initial teaching models, design principles, and guidelines were developed by referring to studies on artificial intelligence convergence education. To validate the developed model, two rounds of expert validation were conducted with three experts in educational technology and AI-integrated education. Additionally, a class was conducted with six middle school students from a gifted education institute, where problems, solvable through a regression analysis model of supervised learning, were explored, and their responses were evaluated. The results indicate that the model can enhance problem formulation competency, AI literacy, and creative thinking skills, while also fostering knowledge in mathematics and information. The significance of this model lies in its ability to systematically design AI convergence courses for improving problem formulation competency.

AB  - Abstract Background Being digitally literate allows health-based science students to access reliable, up-to-date information efficiently and expands the capacity for continuous learning. Digital literacy facilitates effective communication and collaboration among other healthcare providers. It helps to navigate the ethical implications of using digital technologies and aids the use of digital tools in managing healthcare processes. Our aim in this study is to determine the digital literacy level and awareness of our students receiving health-based education in our university and to pave the way for supporting the current curriculum with courses on digital literacy when necessary. Method Students from Acibadem University who were registered undergraduate education for at least four years of health-based education, School of Medicine, Nutrition and Dietetics, Nursing, Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Psychology, Biomedical Engineering, Molecular Biology, and Genetics were included. The questionnaire consisted of 24 queries evaluating digital literacy in 7 fields: software and multimedia, hardware and technical problem solving, network and communication/collaboration, ethics, security, artificial intelligence (A.I.), and interest/knowledge. Two student groups representing all departments were invited for interviews according to the Delphi method. Results The survey was completed by 476 students. Female students had less computer knowledge and previous coding education. Spearman correlation test showed that there were weak positive correlations between the years and the “software and multimedia,” “ethics,” “interest and knowledge” domains, and the average score. The students from Nursing scored lowest in the query after those from the Nutrition and Dietetics department. The highest scores were obtained by Biomedical Engineering students, followed by the School of Medicine. Participants scored the highest in “network” and “A.I.” and lowest in “interest-knowledge” domains. Conclusion It is necessary to define the level of computer skills who start health-based education and shape the curriculum by determining which domains are weak. Creating an educational environment that fosters females’ digital knowledge is recommended. Elective courses across faculties may be offered to enable students to progress and discuss various digital literacy topics. The extent to which students benefit from the digital literacy-supported curriculum may be evaluated. Thus, health-based university students are encouraged to acquire the computer skills required by today’s clinical settings. Registration This study was approved by Acıbadem University and Acıbadem Healthcare Institutions Medical Research Ethics Committee (ATADEK) (11 November 2022, ATADEK registration: 2022-17-138) All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was obtained from the participants.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate the use of Artificial Intelligence in the prevention of violence among middle-school students. The sample for this study consisted of 20 first-year middle-school students who participated in theme selection activities in a free semester program as part of their home economics studies. The data for the study consisted of nine class observation logs, four group activity outputs, 30 class results, an online survey, and in-depth interviews with three students. A program called “R.U.OK” was developed by setting problematic situation for school violence prevention linked to the contents of the Home Economics Education(HEE) curriculum. After the program was implemented, the survey on the students’ class satisfaction content elements, with AI-based learning activities and PBL and interest, displayed high points, with an average of 4.0 or higher. Our qualitative analysis produced four significant results. First, students’ concerns about school violence had increased and they showed a change in attitude, having more empathy with friends and more interest in their surroundings. Second, digital and AI literacy had improved, and students’ interest in digital media learning had increased. Third, there had been an improvement in problem-solving ability in terms of being able to think more critically and independently. Fourth, the results also demonstrated that there had been a positive effect on self-direction and an improved capacity for teamwork. This study was significant in demonstrating the effectiveness of a program for the prevention of school violence based on the use of digital technology in the educational environment.

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a prominent part of modern life, AI literacy is becoming important for all citizens, not just those in technology careers. Previous research in AI education materials has largely focused on the introduction of terminology as well as AI use cases and ethics, but few allow students to learn by creating their own machine learning models. Therefore, there is a need for enriching AI educational tools with more adaptable and flexible platforms for interested educators with any level of technical experience to utilize within their teaching material. As such, we propose the development of an open-source tool (Build-a-Bot) for students and teachers to not only create their own transformer-based chatbots based on their own course material, but also learn the fundamentals of AI through the model creation process. The primary concern of this paper is the creation of an interface for students to learn the principles of artificial intelligence by using a natural language pipeline to train a customized model to answer questions based on their own school curriculums. The model uses contexts given by their instructor, such as chapters of a textbook, to answer questions and is deployed on an interactive chatbot/voice agent. The pipeline teaches students data collection, data augmentation, intent recognition, and question answering by having them work through each of these processes while creating their AI agent, diverging from previous chatbot work where students and teachers use the bots as black-boxes with no abilities for customization or the bots lack AI capabilities, with the majority of dialogue scripts being rule-based. In addition, our tool is designed to make each step of this pipeline intuitive for students at a middle-school level. Further work primarily lies in providing our tool to schools and seeking student and teacher evaluations.

N1  - C. Highlights. 
N1  - C1. Within the past few years, quality STEM education has become an ever-pressing issue, especially in regards to increasing the representation of racial and gender minorities within STEM fields (Fry, Kennedy, and Funk 2021). 
N1  - C2. Much of the current work in artificial intelligence (AI) education centers around curriculum design and classroom implementation – for example, MIT’s AI Ethics for Middle School curriculum focuses on showing students examples of AI that most of them regularly use, developing their programmatic thinking skills, and raising their awareness of ethical issues concerning AI like algorithmic bias (Williams et al 2022). 
N1  - C3. Current literature is primarily focused on lesson and activity design to introduce students to AI terminology and the computational mindset (Kim et al 2021) as well as broad perspective and ethical issues related to AI (Wollowski et al 2016). 
N1  - C4. While previous research has focused on curriculum development, this paper proposes a tool for AI education that would allow students to explore the supervised learning process by creating their own chatbots using a transformer-based language pipeline. 
N1  - C5. Existing curriculums to build AI literacy at the elementary and middle school level largely focus on programmatic thinking and applications of AI: Google’s Teachable Machine is a popular tool to demonstrate the process of learning from a dataset, and students may be more directly instructed on examples of AI seen in daily life, like YouTube’s recommendation system (Sabuncuoglu 2020). 
N1  - C6. Build-a-Bot implements these methodologies in its design; students learn by studying and modifying a complex language system, rather than being directly instructed on AI principles. 
N1  - C7. When BERT is fine-tuned with a smaller set of labeled data, it can be used for a variety of natural language tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis. 
N1  - C8. When using Build-a-Bot, students train their own BERT model for intent recognition based on questions that they write and label. 
N1  - C9. A BERT-based architecture trained on the student question dataset is used for the intent recognition model, with the number of epochs set by the students while they learn about model training. 
N1  - C10. We created a pipeline with multiple transformers to generate natural language answers to student questions; we used this pipeline to make an open-source tool to enable students to learn the supervised learning process by training the models in the pipeline. 
N1  - C11. The tool is inexpensive to use and practical for a classroom environment, as instructors can download the tool as an executable file and deploy it without any programming knowledge. This enables educators of any level of technical experience to build their students’ AI literacy with a curriculum based around constructivist learning theory.

N1  - E25. The tool implements constructivist methodologies, such as student-centered learning, active learning, and transformational teaching, to promote dynamic relationships between students and instructors.. 
N1  - E26. Data Collection And Augmentation. 
N1  - E27. Students collect data in the form of questions, which are then labeled with an intent set by their instructor (Gorton et al 2011).. 
N1  - E28. Data augmentation is necessary due to the small size of the natural language dataset, and backtranslation is used to generate synthetic data (Feng et al 2021).. 
N1  - E29. The NLPAug library is used to implement this technique on the student-created question dataset (Ma 2019)..

AB  - AI is considered as a rapidly advancing technological domain capable of altering every aspect of our lives and society. However, many developing countries lack the basic infrastructure needed for taking advantage of AI systems, which could worsen the new technological, economic, and social divides. Ensuring the inclusion and equity of AI in education is one of the challenges that we need to solve. How can we support the urgent needs of developing countries and the underprivileged communities so that the divide between “haves” and “have-nots” will not continue to grow? This is the core question that this project is trying to address. This paper introduces the AI-robotics project focusing on developing an open-source affordable AI-robotics tool to address the need to promote AI literacy around the world. CogBots, the AI-empowered educational learning tool, has been in development collaboratively with Google, CogLabs and UNESCO. The project targets upper elementary and middle school students to promote AI literacy, including the 5 Big Ideas in AI, using the AI-powered educational robotics tool and the Teachable Machine by Google Creative Lab providing a machine learning experience.

AB  - Abstract Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing many industries and becoming increasingly ubiquitous in everyday life. To empower children growing up with AI to navigate society’s evolving sociotechnical context, we developed three middle school AI literacy curricula: Creative AI, Dancing with AI, and How to Train Your Robot. In this paper we discuss how we leveraged three design principles—active learning, embedded ethics, and low barriers to access – to effectively engage students in learning to create and critique AI artifacts. During the summer of 2020, we recruited and trained in-service, middle school teachers from across the United States to co-instruct online workshops with students from their schools. In the workshops, a combination of hands-on unplugged and programming activities facilitated students’ understanding of AI. As students explored technical concepts in tandem with ethical ones, they developed a critical lens to better grasp how AI systems work and how they impact society. We sought to meet the specified needs of students from a range of backgrounds by minimizing the prerequisite knowledge and technology resources students needed to participate. Finally, we conclude with lessons learned and design recommendations for future AI curricula, especially for K-12 in-person and virtual learning.

N1  - C. Highlights. 
N1  - C1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the study of how humans construct machines to embody mechanisms of thought and intelligent behavior (AAAI, 2020). 
N1  - C2. What kinds of understanding about AI do students demonstrate after engaging in our lessons, interactive activities, and tools? What student-driven projects did our curricula enable?. 
N1  - C3. We found that students were overall extremely aware of the existence of artificial intelligence. 
N1  - C4. The learning objectives of Creative AI include: Understanding generative algorithms and their applications: Students can describe how generative adversarial networks (GANs) work, infer how different examples of GANs were built, and apply techniques to determine if a piece of media was likely to be produced by GANs. 
N1  - C5. The learning objectives of the Dancing with AI curriculum are as follows: Training supervised machine learning models from data: Students understand the relevance of datasets to machine learning models and how different dataset features impact the performance of a model. 
N1  - C6. Students engaged in the “Examples of Classification in AI” to learn about how classifiers work at a high level, and how machine learning algorithms identify features within images to classify them. 
N1  - C7. The learning objectives of How to Train Your Robot include: Understanding supervised machine learning algorithms: Students can articulate how neural networks and K Nearest Neighbors algorithms learn from datasets to make predictions. 
N1  - C8. Children in general are underrepresented as inventors of AI systems, though their experiences lend a unique perspective to what they create with AI. 
N1  - C9. A dataset that contains a gender bias for occupations could be used in an AI system that unintentionally discriminates against people or offends them by perpetuating a stereotype. 
N1  - C10. We propose making future AI education even more accessible by developing platforms that work on all kinds of devices, including older computers, mobile devices, and community computers. 
N1  - C11. The United States of America designates schools as Title 1 if at least 40% of students come from households below the poverty threshold.Footnote 15 Of the remaining schools, one was a private, charter school where 96% of the students are African, Hispanic, or Indigenous Americans. 
N1  - C12. This paper describes how we designed and executed three project-based curricula in an online learning environment to make AI education more accessible to middle school students. 
N1  - D. Findings. 
N1  - D1. The United States of America designates schools as Title 1 if at least 40% of students come from households below the poverty threshold.Footnote 15 Of the remaining schools, one was a private, charter school where 96% of the students are African, Hispanic, or Indigenous Americans. 
N1  - D2. And the fourth school was a public school where 32.8% of students are African, Hispanic, or Indigenous Americans. 
N1  - D3. Across all three curricula, 90.5% (n = 74 total responses) of students had heard of AI before and an overwhelming majority of students had interacted with AI integrated technologies such as YouTube (100%, n = 45), Google Search (95.6%, n = 43), and Netflix (88.9%, n = 40) before (Fig. 3). 
N1  - D4. Students were most confident that Voice Assistants (93.2% “Does use AI”, n = 44), Google Search (79.6%, n = 44), Game Consoles (77.3%, n = 44), and GPS Apps (72.7%, n = 44) use AI. 
N1  - D5. Students were least sure whether Video Calls (21.6% said “Not sure this uses AI”, n = 37), Game Consoles (13.64%, n = 44), Snapchat Filters (13.62%, n = 44), and Wireless Printers (13.51%, n = 37) used AI. 
N1  - D6. Students also believed that AI could create music (89.2%, n = 37) and make a painting (77.8%, n = 37). 
N1  - D7. Responses such as baking a cake (35.1%, n = 37), styling hair (43.2%, n = 37) and hitting a baseball (48.6%, n = 37) were less popular. 
N1  - D8. In terms of how they saw AI playing out in technology, more students believed that AI would make jobs easier (73.0%, n = 37) rather than take over jobs. 
N1  - D9. We observed that only a small minority of students answered that they were smarter than AI (17.1%, n = 35), and only 33.3% (n = 37) of students believed that they exclusively could exclusively control AI. 
N1  - D10. In the pre-test, students also showed that 62.9% (n = 35 total responses) of students want to work with computers and technology in the future, and 71.4% considered themselves to be tech savvy; only 14.3% of students reported that they found computers confusing, and only 11.4% (n = 35) said that they do not know a lot about computers. 
N1  - D11. More students selected the correct answer, b, at the end of the workshop (70.6%) versus the beginning of the workshop (41.2%). 
N1  - D12. Of the 58 responses, 65% of student responses were able to correctly identify what the generator was trying to generate, and 61% of student responses were able to correctly identify the dataset that the discriminator was trained on. 
N1  - D13. 14 (42.42%, n = 33) students chose the Dr Seuss style, 7 (21.21%, n = 33) chose the Harry Potter style, 3 (9.09%, n = 33) chose the Wizard of Oz style, 2 (6.06%, n = 33) chose Williams Shakespeare, Carl Sagan, Knock-knock jokes, and Life of Pi styles each.

N1  - E13. This paper describes how we designed and executed three project-based curricula in an online learning environment to make AI education more accessible to middle school students. 
N1  - E14. AI Education. 
N1  - E15. The movement to teach artificial intelligence (AI) to K-12 students has surged in recent years, with multiple AI literacy platforms and lesson plans developed (Long &amp; Magerko, 2020; Touretzky et al, 2019b).. 
N1  - E16. AI education is essential for students growing up in the era of AI, as they need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to participate in the creation and critique of AI artifacts (DiPaola et al, 2020).. 
N1  - E17. The AI4K12 initiative has defined the "Five Big Ideas of AI" that K-12 students must know, including Perception, Representation and Reasoning, Learning, Natural Interaction, and Societal Impact.. 
N1  - E18. Curriculum Design. 
N1  - E19. The authors developed three middle school AI literacy curricula: Creative AI, Dancing with AI, and How to Train Your Robot, which incorporated active learning, embedded ethics, and low barriers to access (Ali et al, 2021a; DiPaola et al, 2021; Jordan et al, 2021).. 
N1  - E20. The curricula featured AI concepts and technologies that have recently become more accessible to the public, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), affective perception, and autonomous robotics.. 
N1  - E21. The authors used a mixed methods approach to evaluate their three curricula and associated webtools, materials, and practices.. 
N1  - E22. Lessons Learned. 
N1  - E23. The authors conclude with recommendations for future AI curricula that seek to broaden access to K-12 AI education, including the importance of hands-on activities, project-based learning, and critical reflection about societal implications.. 
N1  - E24. The authors highlight the need for educators to find a balance between learning about AI and assembling robot kits, as robots may disrupt the learning process (Koski et al, 2008; Talaga &amp; Oh, 2009).. 
N1  - E25. The authors emphasize the importance of preparing in-service teachers to bring AI education to their classrooms, addressing potential barriers for broader adoption of AI curricula.. 
N1  - E26. Generative ML And Ethics. 
N1  - E27. Generative AI tools, such as GANs, can be used to create fake media that deceives others (Nguyen et al, 2019).. 
N1  - E28. However, they can also be used to enhance creativity in children (Ali et al, 2020).. 
N1  - E29. The centrality of ethics is critical as AI systems have historically been biased against marginalized groups (Buolamwini &amp; Gebru, 2018; Eubanks, 2018; Noble, 2018; O'Neil, 2016).. 
N1  - E30. AI Education And Curriculum Design. 
N1  - E31. There is a lack of published curricula on teaching K-12 students about generative ML.. 
N1  - E32. Collegiate AI courses have historically overlooked ethics, but this is beginning to change (Fiesler et al, 2020)..

AB  - An essential element of K-12 AI literacy is educating learners about the ethical and societal implications of AI systems. Previous work in AI ethics literacy have developed curriculum and classroom activities that engage learners in reflecting on the ethical implications of AI systems and developing responsible AI. There is little work in using game-based learning methods in AI literacy. Games are known to be compelling media to teach children about complex STEM concepts. In this work, we developed a competitive card game for middle and high school students called "AI Audit" where they play as AI start-up founders building novel AI-powered technology. Players can challenge other players with potential harms of their technology or defend their own businesses by features that mitigate these harms. The game mechanics reward systems that are ethically developed or that take steps to mitigate potential harms. In this paper, we present the game design, teacher resources for classroom deployment and early playtesting results. We discuss our reflections about using games as teaching tools for AI literacy in K-12 classrooms.

N1  - C. Highlights. 
N1  - C1. Tools and systems powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have become an undeniable part of our everyday lives. 
N1  - C2. The AI4k12 initiative that was established by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) has determined the “Big 5 ideas in AI” which determine what students should know about AI and be able to do with it (Touretzky et al 2019). 
N1  - C3. Previous work has used teaching lectures where instructors discuss how certain AI systems have impacted society, or unplugged activities where students reflect on who stakeholders of the technology are and how they could be positive or negatively impacted, or project-based learning approaches where students designing an algorithm reflect on its societal implications and minimize harm. 
N1  - C4. In 2018, AAAI and CSTA developed national guidelines for teaching AI to K-12 students, where they outlined 5 big ideas that all students must know: computers perceive the world using sensors, agents maintain models/representations of the world and use them for reasoning, computers can learn from data, making agents interact comfortably with humans is a substantial challenge for AI developers, and AI applications can impact society in both positive and negative ways (Touretzky et al 2019). 
N1  - C5. Players play as business owners that set up new businesses - an attempt to replicate the real world creators of technology who are reflecting on the ethical implications of the AI-powered businesses they are creating. 
N1  - C6. One player who had the “Generate AI Art Magazine” business was confused about how it can lead to “Wrongful arrests of people”. When they referred to the guide, they learned that generative AI can be used to create Deepfakes, or modified videos of people and create false evidence presentable in court. 
N1  - C7. Leaning on the structure of educational scaffolds (Melero, Hernández-Leo, and Blat 2011), the wild cards act as a space with lesser imposed structure inviting players to engage in the practice of understanding the broader systems, anticipating impacts of AI systems, and improving these systems to respond to possible harm. 
N1  - C8. While existing works in K-12 AI Ethics literacy enable children to critique existing AI technologies and identify their potential harms, this work allows them to put themselves in the shoes of the creators of these technologies and conceptualize their responsible redesign, while being supported by learning materials that scaffold their knowledge about AI-enabled societal harms. 
N1  - C9. We designed a card game for middle and high school students to reflect on the ethical implications of everyday AI systems. 
N1  - C10. In our initial playtesting with adults, we found that the game was engaging and fun, even for adults, but players found some content challenging. 
N1  - C11. We found that the accompanying education materials were helpful and that players gained new insights about societal implications that they were not aware of, or were reminded to think critically about the ones that they were aware of. 
N1  - D. Findings. 
N1  - D1. Over 60% of players participate in offline or online social communities related to their gameplay (Picton, Clark, and Judge 2020).

AB  - This study dealt with the artificial intelligence (AI) usage and its influence on students’ academic writing. The primary goal of the study was to determine the level of artificial intelligence (AI) usage and students’ academic writing in terms of their respective indicators, the significant difference between artificial intelligence (AI) usage and students’, and what domains of artificial intelligence (AI) substantially influenced students’ academic writing. Also, this study utilized a quantitative-correlational design with 335 participants among Junior High School and Senior High School students in Lorenzo S. Sarmiento Sr. National High School. The average weighted mean, Pearson R, and multiple regression analysis were the statistical tools used in this study. Along with this, the results showed a high level of artificial intelligence (AI) usage in terms of satisfaction, AI literacy, relevance of AI, and confidence. Likewise, results showed a high level of students’ academic writing in terms of usefulness, ease of use, and attitude towards usage. In addition, there was a high correlation, and a significant relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) usage and its influence on the students’ academic writing. Hence, this led to the rejection of the null hypothesis. The domains of artificial intelligence (AI) usage that influenced students’ academic writing are the relevance of AI, confidence, and AI literacy. While satisfaction, as a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) usage, had no significant influence on students’ academic writing. Thus, educational institutions could harness the positive influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on students’ academic writing, creating a more technologically advanced, collaborative, and effective learning environment while encouraging students to participate in AI-assisted activities contributing to better progress and improved self-regulated learning as they interacted with AI tools and their peers in an academic setting.

AB  - This study aims to develop and validate a home economics education program focused on the consumer life area to enhance artificial intelligence (AI) literacy. To achieve this objective, a 10-session AI-consumer life integration education program was developed by analyzing literature on AI Literacy, AI curriculum, consumer education, and the home economics curriculum for the middle school consumer life area. The program’s validity was assessed by nine teachers using a four-point Likert scale. The average scores for each item and the content validity index (CVI) were calculated. Based on expert feedback, the program was revised and improved accordingly. The expert validity assessment of the lesson plans, teaching materials and learning resources resulted in an average score of 3.78 for all items and an average CVI of 0.96. For the overall program, the expert validity assessment yielded an average score of 3.72 for all items and an average CVI of 0.97. Since the content validity index for all questions was above 0.78, the program demonstrated high validity across achievement standards integration, learning objectives, content and teaching methods, motivation, and volume areas. This confirms its effectiveness as an educational program for enhancing AI literacy. This study is significant in terms of defining and identifying the components of AI literacy, developing an AI-integrated program encompassing the entire consumer life area and confirming the suitability of the home economics curriculum for enhancing digital consumer competencies and promoting sustainable consumption.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches open up new avenues of digital creation, and are simultaneously accompanied by societal and ethical implications such as the creation of Deepfakes and spread of misinformation, renewing our understanding of technical AI systems as socio-technical systems. Applications of, and media generated by generative AI techniques are abundantly present on social media platforms frequented by children, who are not yet aware of the existence of AI-manipulated media. Previous work has highlighted the importance of digital media literacy and AI literacy for children. In this work, we introduce middle school students to generative AI techniques as a tool for creation, while also focusing on critical discussion about their societal and ethical implications, and encouraging pro-activeness in being responsible consumers, creators and stakeholders of technology. We present learning activities that introduce 38 middle-school students to generative modeling, how it is used to generate Deepfakes, cues that help to recognize Deepfakes, and the spread and effects of misinformation. Students demonstrated an understanding that generative media may be believable, but not necessarily true, and can contribute to the spread of misinformation. They were also able to identify why misinformation may be harmful or lasting, drawing specific examples to social settings that indicate human-centered implications. Finally, students expressed opinions about policies surrounding the presence of Deepfakes on social media. This approach can be adopted to introduce students to other technical systems that constitute both productive applications and potential negative implications of technology. ⋅Applied computing → Interactive learning environments; ⋅Human-centered computing → Social media; Social networks; ⋅Social and professional topics → Computing literacy; K-12 education; Misinformation, Deepfakes, digital literacy, media literacy, social media.

AB  - Ongoing advancements in generative AI (GenAI) have boosted the potential of applying long-standing "learning-by-teaching" practices in the form of a teachable agent (TA). Despite the recognized roles and opportunities of TAs, less is known about how GenAI could create synergy or introduce challenges in TAs and how students perceived the application of GenAI in TAs. This study explored middle school students' perceived roles, benefits, and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs in an authentic mathematics classroom. Through classroom observation, focus-group interviews, and open-ended surveys of 108 sixth-grade students, we found that students expected the GenAI-powered TA to serve as a learning companion, facilitator, and collaborative problem-solver. Students also expressed the benefits and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs. This study provides implications for the design of educational AI and AI-assisted instruction.

AB  - Abstract This paper provides an experience report on a co‐design approach with teachers to co‐create learning analytics‐based technology to support problem‐based learning in middle school science classrooms. We have mapped out a workflow for such applications and developed design narratives to investigate the implementation, modifications and temporal roles of the participants in the design process. Our results provide precedent knowledge on co‐designing with experienced and novice teachers and co‐constructing actionable insight that can help teachers engage more effectively with their students' learning and problem‐solving processes during classroom PBL implementations. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Success of educational technology depends in large part on the technology's alignment with teachers' goals for their students, teaching strategies and classroom context. Teacher and researcher co‐design of educational technology and supporting curricula has proven to be an effective way for integrating teacher insight and supporting their implementation needs. Co‐designing learning analytics and support technologies with teachers is difficult due to differences in design and development goals, workplace norms, and AI‐literacy and learning analytics background of teachers. What this paper adds We provide a co‐design workflow for middle school teachers that centres on co‐designing and developing actionable insights to support problem‐based learning (PBL) by systematic development of responsive teaching practices using AI‐generated learning analytics. We adapt established human‐computer interaction (HCI) methods to tackle the complex task of classroom PBL implementation, working with experienced and novice teachers to create a learning analytics dashboard for a PBL curriculum. We demonstrate researcher and teacher roles and needs in ensuring co‐design collaboration and the co‐construction of actionable insight to support middle school PBL. Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics researchers will be able to use the workflow as a tool to support their PBL co‐design processes. Learning analytics researchers will be able to apply adapted HCI methods for effective co‐design processes. Co‐design teams will be able to pre‐emptively prepare for the difficulties and needs of teachers when integrating middle school teacher feedback during the co‐design process in support of PBL technologies.

AB  - The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our society makes it urgent and necessary to develop young students’ AI literacy so that they can become informed citizens and critical consumers of AI technology. Over the past decade many efforts have focused on developing curricular materials that make AI concepts accessible and engaging to young learners; and yet, limited research investigated how to assess learners’ AI literacy, which is critically important to inform the teaching and learning of AI. This paper addresses this issue by reporting the development and validation findings of the AI Literacy Concept Inventory Assessment (AI-CI), a set of multiple-choice questions designed to assess understanding of AI literacy concepts among middle school students. The AI-CI consists of 20 multiple choice questions examining student understanding of four topics: AI general concepts, logic systems, machine learning general concepts, and supervised learning. The content validity of AI-CI was established through multiple rounds of expert panel reviews with AI educators and experts, observations of student learning of AI, and cognitive validation interviews. The validity of the AI-CI was established with a sample of 981 students and the pre-posttest reliability was established with a sample of 108 middle school students who learned AI through experiencing the Developing AI literacy (DAILy) curriculum. The findings show that the AI-CI is a valid and reliable tool to assess AI literacy at the middle school level.

AB  - The ActiveAI project addresses key challenges in AI education for grades 7-9 students by providing an engaging AI literacy learning experience based on the AI4K12 knowledge framework. Utilizing learning science mechanisms such as goal-based scenarios, immediate feedback, project-based learning, and intelligent agents, the app incorporates a variety of learner inputs like sliders, steppers, and collectors to enhance understanding. In these courses, students work on real-world scenarios like analyzing sentiment in social media comments. This helps them learn to effectively engage with AI systems and develop their ability to evaluate AI-generated output. The Learning Engineering Process (LEP) guided the project's creation and data instrumentation, focusing on design and impact. The project is currently in the implementation stage, leveraging the intelligent tutor design principles for app development. The extended abstract presents the foundational design and development, with further evaluation and research to be conducted in the future.

AB  - In the junior middle school of compulsory education in China, artificial intelligence courses are being rapidly promoted to help students form artificial intelligence literacy. Then, how to define the connotation of junior high school students' artificial intelligence literacy, build a literacy evaluation framework, and provide decision support for students' information literacy level improvement is an urgent topic to be studied at present. Based on this, this study deeply analyzes the development context and connotation of artificial intelligence literacy and information literacy, and defines the connotation of literacy with emphasis on the uniqueness and independence of artificial intelligence literacy. Based on this, we design the evaluation framework of artificial intelligence literacy in junior high schools, and evaluate the artificial intelligence literacy level of junior high school students in Qingdao Artificial Intelligence Education Experimental Zone, China. The evaluation results show that the overall level of students' artificial intelligence literacy is high, but the development in four dimensions is uneven. There are significant differences in artificial intelligence literacy among junior middle school students with different gender, grade, class frequency, task cooperation frequency, learning value and goal, and self-efficacy. Finally, according to the evaluation results, this study puts forward the corresponding strategies to improve the quality of artificial intelligence.

AB  - Abstract The increasing attention to Machine Learning (ML) in K-12 levels and studies exploring a different aspect of research on K-12 ML has necessitated the need to synthesize this existing research. This study systematically reviewed how research on ML teaching and learning in K-12 has fared, including the current area of focus, and the gaps that need to be addressed in the literature in future studies. We reviewed 43 conference and journal articles to analyze specific focus areas of ML learning and teaching in K-12 from four perspectives as derived from the data: curriculum development, technology development, pedagogical development, and teacher training/professional development. The findings of our study reveal that (a) additional ML resources are needed for kindergarten to middle school and informal settings, (b) further studies need to be conducted on how ML can be integrated into subject domains other than computing, (c) most of the studies focus on pedagogical development with a dearth of teacher professional development programs, and (d) more evidence of societal and ethical implications of ML should be considered in future research. While this study recognizes the present gaps and direction for future research, these findings provide insight for educators, practitioners, instructional designers, and researchers into K-12 ML research trends to advance the quality of the emerging field.

N1  - C. Highlights. 
N1  - C1. Popular interest in artificial intelligence (AI) has increased incredibly in recent times. 
N1  - C2. Even though no systematic reviews have been identified that explicitly examine the current focus area of K-12 machine learning (ML) including issues that require further research, we have identified seven literature reviews on K-12 AI/ML education. 
N1  - C3. This literature review analyzes K-12 ML studies and finds existing gaps and prospective suggestions to conceive and cultivate ML knowledge. 
N1  - C4. Our findings reveal that ML resources were designed and utilized across K-12 settings. 
N1  - C5. This paper aims to aggregate the ML research in K-12 system that have been investigated. 
N1  - C6. We propose that scholars and K-12 AI/ML practitioners consider the following takeaways when designing ML activities or studies: (a) create more ML activities for kindergarten to middle school, development of teacher training, and education in an informal context; (b) incorporate ML ideas in subject domains other than computing to encourage the integration of ML in schools; (c) develop assessment for ML that can be relevant across levels for students’ comparability in ML understanding across learning settings (d) consider societal and ethical implications of ML to better understand students’ proficiency of ML; (e) conduct studies focusing on Africa as well as comparative studies exploring different regions to understand how to better introduce ML across climes. 
N1  - C7. Given that ML has been introduced across K-12 levels, creating a catalog that houses the activities, platforms, and assessments for stakeholders in need of the ML resources would be valuable for the development of the growing field.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence technologies are becoming ubiquitous, transforming the workforce by altering or creating jobs and influencing decisions that affect minority communities. The necessity of AI literacy, comprising knowledge and skills for critical interaction with AI, is increasingly important. Multilingual learners, engaging with both every day and domain-specific vocabulary and syntax, must acquire AI literacy, necessitating tailored pedagogical practices. This article outlines three strategies implemented for multilingual middle school students during a summer camp in Southern California. We argue for a mutually beneficial relationship between acquiring second language proficiency and AI literacy. Supporting these processes, we present three pedagogical strategies: (1) storytelling to model AI decision-making, (2) role-playing as an AI to demonstrate programmability and learning from data, and (3) programming text-to-speech-to-text AI to illustrate sensor functionality and action-reaction concepts. Additionally, we discuss their alignment with AI competencies. These strategies potentially foster linguistic scaffolding and translanguaging, aiding multilingual learners in acquiring new literacies.

N1  - E14. Objectives. 
N1  - E15. It's crucial to emphasize that our aim is to initiate a dialogue within the educational community about these practices rather than present this narrative as formal empirical research. 
N1  - E16. Ai Literacy. 
N1  - E17. Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly present in many aspects of human life, making AI literacy, comprising knowledge and skills for critical interaction with AI, essential (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2015; Long &amp; Magerko, 2020).. 
N1  - E18. AI literacy encompasses a broad range of resources for teachers and learners, including curricula, digital tools, and teaching guides (Ng et al, 2021).. 
N1  - E19. Multilingual Learners And AI Literacy. 
N1  - E20. Multilingual learners must acquire AI literacy, necessitating tailored pedagogical practices that integrate linguistic resources from various languages throughout the curriculum (Vogel et al, 2019).. 
N1  - E21. There is a mutually beneficial relationship between acquiring second language proficiency and AI literacy, as AI-based technologies can facilitate interactive dialogues in multiple languages and provide tools for learners to explore and express their bilingual and multilingual identities (Topsakal and Topsakal, 2022; Du &amp; Tate, 2024).. 
N1  - E22. AI literacy activities that capitalize on learners' existing linguistic skills offer significant benefits to multilingual learners, and conversational agents are particularly suitable for linguistic practices due to their design, which enables interaction through reading, writing, speaking, and listening (García et al, 2017).. 
N1  - E23. Pedagogical Strategies. 
N1  - E24. Three pedagogical strategies for multilingual elementary and middle school students aimed at enhancing specific AI literacy competencies using conversational agent technologies are: (1) storytelling to model AI decision-making, (2) role-playing as an AI to demonstrate programmability and learning from data, and (3) programming text-to-speech-to-text AI to illustrate sensor functionality and action-reaction concepts.. 
N1  - E25. These strategies potentially foster linguistic scaffolding and translanguaging, aiding multilingual learners in acquiring new literacies.. 
N1  - E26. Decision-Making And Storytelling. 
N1  - E27. The lesson used Apple's Siri to illustrate AI decision-making, demonstrating how Siri makes decisions like determining when to activate.. 
N1  - E28. A decision tree was introduced to the class, with the root node posing the question, "Is someone saying 'Hey Siri' or 'Oye Siri'?". 
N1  - E29. The exercise effectively visualized the decision-making process for the students, and the instructor drew a parallel between decision trees in AI and storytelling, referencing "Choose Your Own Adventure" stories.. 
N1  - E30. The instructor used seven images to inspire different story elements, crafting a two-layer decision tree to demonstrate how decision trees can map out narrative paths in a story, mirroring the decision-making process in AI (Jacob et al., 2018; Minsky, 2019).. 
N1  - E31. Programmability And Learning From Data. 
N1  - E32. The second strategy involved role-playing as an AI to model Programmability and Learning from Data, deepening students' understanding of how AI works.. 
N1  - E33. Students simulated the operations of a conversational agent, interacting with Siri and posing questions to deepen their understanding of how Siri knows what to answer to a prompt and how Siri learned so many languages.. 
N1  - E34. The activity introduced the concept of a database of answers linked to specific prompts, and students created their own databases and took on the role of a conversational agent, being "trained" on the database and subsequently "tested" on their knowledge.. 
N1  - E35. Programming Text-to-Speech-to-Text AI. 
N1  - E36. The third strategy involved programming text-to-speech-to-text AI to illustrate sensor functionality and action-reaction concepts, engaging students with the Action-Reaction and Sensors competencies.. 
N1  - E37. Students used Scratch to develop an application that captures human speech, translates it into text, converts this text into another language, and finally vocalizes the translated text as spoken words using the computer's voice.. 
N1  - E38. The activity aimed to enable learners to understand that conversational agents detect and interpret human speech using microphones, and that these agents can reason and react to user input.. 
N1  - E39. Designing AI Literacy Curriculum. 
N1  - E40. The authors designed an AI literacy curriculum incorporating effective practices for engaging multilingual students in STEM education, following guidelines set by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2018).. 
N1  - E41. The approach involved practical applications in computer science, fostering rich classroom discourse, utilizing students' diverse linguistic resources, and maintaining a focus on the role of language in computer science and AI contexts.. 
N1  - E42. Inclusive Teaching Approach. 
N1  - E43. The authors employed an inclusive teaching approach, providing instructions in both English and Spanish, and actively welcoming and encouraging translanguaging during activities.. 
N1  - E44. This flexibility enabled students to communicate in their preferred language, translating concepts and explanations back and forth.. 
N1  - E45. The authors also emphasized the use of multiple registers and modalities, including nonlinguistic aspects like images and physical gestures.. 
N1  - E46. AI Literacy Pedagogical Strategies. 
N1  - E47. The authors outlined three AI literacy pedagogical strategies: storytelling, role-playing, and programming.. 
N1  - E48. These strategies immersed students in disciplinary practices integral to AI, such as considering decision outcomes and algorithmic thinking.. 
N1  - E49. The multimodal nature of the Scratch environment enabled students to create interactive, animated characters, incorporating elements of their personal lives into their projects (Ojeda-Ramirez et al, 2023).
