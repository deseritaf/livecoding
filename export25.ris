AB  - The advent of the 4th Industrial Revolution era requires the creation of new value through convergence rather than piecemeal use of technology. In that sense, the convergence of AI’s learning ability and IoT connectivity makes it possible to build a more intelligent and automated system. Therefore, AI education in preparation for the era of hyper-convergence and hyper-connectivity should not stop at just experiencing artificial intelligence technology and understanding its principles, but should move toward experiencing a more expanded world. Accordingly, major countries around the world believe that young learners need the ability to naturally access and handle the latest technology, and are actively taking the lead in information education, including AI education, from kindergarten to elementary and middle school. Accordingly, this researcher believed that for elementary school students who fall into the specific operational stage of Piaget’s cognitive development theory, AIoT education is necessary as AI convergence education that creates specific outputs in connection with real life. To this end, we developed an AIoT education program (12 topics, 24 sessions in total) using DIYGO, which can implement IoT robots using various input/output sensors and CPU boards. Among these, considering the students’ level and interest, the contents of the 12th session on 6 topics were applied to an experimental class of 6th grade elementary school students (24 students), and effectiveness was verified through pre- and post-paired sample t-tests. The measurement tools used to verify the effectiveness of this study are the AI literacy test tool developed by Kim (Effect of PBL-based AI convergence education programs on AI literacy and creative problem-solving skills of elementary school students, 2023) and the digital literacy test tool developed by Lee et al. (2021). The test sheet questions were reorganized focusing on questions on areas related to the learning elements covered in the AIoT education program. In addition, exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis were conducted to verify the validity and reliability of the measurement tool used in this study, and the results showed a relatively good reliability level of over 0.6. When AIoT education using DIYGO was conducted, the pre- and post-difference test results of students’ digital literacy showed statistically significant improvements in all detailed areas of digital literacy. Additionally, the difference verification results for AI literacy showed that it was effective in all detailed areas. Based on the above results, first, at a time when digital and AI literacy is becoming important, AIoT education can be an effective method for cultivating digital and AI literacy in future talent. Second, AIoT education shows the potential as a form of AI convergence education that is integrated with life and solving real-life problems.

AB  - AI has become ubiquitous in our society, accelerated by the speed of the development of machine learning algorithms and voice and facial recognition technologies used in our everyday lives. Furthermore, AI-enhanced technologies and tools are no strangers in the field of education. It is more evident that it is important to prepare K-12 population of students for their future professions as well as citizens capable of understanding and utilizing AI-enhanced technologies in the future. In response to such needs, the authors started a collaborative project aiming to provide a K-12 AI curriculum for Japanese students. However, the authors soon realized that it is important to contextualize the learning experience for the targeted K-12 students. The paper aims at introducing the idea of contextualizing AI education and learning experience of K-12 students with examples and tips using the work-in-progress version of the contextualized curriculum using culturally responsive approaches to promote the awareness and understanding of AI ethics among middle school students.

AB  - As smart technology promotes the development of various industries, artificial intelligence (AI) has also become an important driving force for innovation and transformation in education. For teachers, how to skillfully apply AI in teaching and improve their AI literacy has become a necessary goal for their sustainable professional development. This research examines the correlations among the dimensions of AI literacy of teachers in order to promote the effectiveness of class teaching and the adoption of artificial intelligence literacy (AIL). Our findings are based on the analysis of 1013 survey results, where we tested the level of AI literacy of teachers, including Knowing and Understanding AI (KUAI), Applying AI (AAI), Evaluating AI Application (EAIA), and AI Ethics (AIE). We find that AAI had a significant, positive effect on the other three dimensions. Thus, based on the analysis, the government should take action to cultivate teachers’ AI literacy. In order to improve teachers’ AI literacy, the choice of curriculum, content, methods, and practical resources for special training should be diverse and committed to making AI literacy an essential enabler for teachers’ sustainable future development.

AB  - With the rapid development of societal information, electronic educational resources have become an indispensable component of modern education. In response to the increasingly formidable challenges faced by secondary school teachers, this study endeavors to analyze and explore the application of artificial intelligence (AI) methods to enhance their cognitive literacy. Initially, this discourse delves into the application of AI-generated electronic images in the training and instruction of middle school educators, subjecting it to thorough analysis. Emphasis is placed on elucidating the pivotal role played by AI electronic images in elevating the proficiency of middle school teachers. Subsequently, an integrated intelligent device serves as the foundation for establishing a model that applies intelligent classification and algorithms based on the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO). This model is designed to assess the cognitive literacy and teaching efficacy of middle school educators, and its performance is juxtaposed with classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and decision trees. The findings reveal that, following 600 iterations of the model, the SVM algorithm achieves a 77% accuracy rate in recognizing teacher literacy, whereas the SOLO algorithm attains 80%. Concurrently, the spatial complexities of the SVM-based and SOLO-based intelligent literacy improvement models are determined to be 45 and 22, respectively.

AB  - The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) necessitates promoting AI education at the K-12 level. However, educating young learners to become AI literate citizens poses several challenges. The components of AI literacy are ill-defined and it is unclear to what extent middle school students can engage in learning about AI as a sociotechnical system with socio-political implications. In this paper we posit that students must learn three core domains of AI: technical concepts and processes, ethical and societal implications, and career futures in the AI era. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) workshop that aimed to integrate middle school students’ learning of the three domains. We found that after the workshop, most students developed a general understanding of AI concepts and processes (e.g., supervised learning and logic systems). More importantly, they were able to identify bias, describe ways to mitigate bias in machine learning, and start to consider how AI may impact their future lives and careers. At exit, nearly half of the students explained AI as not just a technical subject, but one that has personal, career, and societal implications. Overall, this finding suggests that the approach of incorporating ethics and career futures into AI education is age appropriate and effective for developing AI literacy among middle school students. This study contributes to the field of AI Education by presenting a model of integrating ethics into the teaching of AI that is appropriate for middle school students.

The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in industry and academic fields, made possible by enormous amounts of data and computation power, necessitates the development of a workforce that is knowledgeable and capable of working with AI (Manyika et al, 2017; National Science Board, 2020). 
N1  - C2. Many K-12 students, those underrepresented in STEM/Computing, may feel unprepared and not be able to persist and succeed in completing these courses. In their systematic mapping study, noted that many curricula teaching Machine Learning at the K-12 level employed the interactive approach where students are exposed to AI concepts through interactions with AI tools as an end-user followed with some degree of knowledge building and reasoning about how AI works. 
N1  - C3. The Developing AI Literacy” (DAILy) curriculum is organized by a hierarchy of key technical concepts that have been suggested age appropriate based on our previous work (Ali et al, 2019), including (1) an Introduction to AI, (2) Logic Systems, (3) Machine Learning, (4) Supervised learning and (5) Unsupervised learning. 
N1  - C4. To explore what kinds of ideas students developed about AI’s ethical and societal implications through the DAILy workshop, we examined the interviews conducted with the 19 students after the workshop. 
N1  - C5. This paper aims to help fill in this gap by reporting the design and implementation of the DAILy curriculum that interweaves student learning of the technical, ethical or societal, and career aspects of AI. 
N1  - C6. Our results demonstrate that the DAILy workshop was engaging and productive in supporting student learning of general concepts of AI concepts, logic systems, and machine learning.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping education by introducing tools that enhance teaching methodologies, personalize learning, and streamline administrative tasks. However, adoption of these tools remains uneven, raising concerns about disparities in AI literacy and competency across geographic regions and educational contexts. Here we investigate the adoption of GenAI tools among second language (L2) educators in the United States, Colombia, Germany, and Macau—professionals uniquely positioned to benefit from and highlight barriers to GenAI integration. Using survey data, we assess four areas: accessibility of GenAI tools, teacher knowledge of potential applications, integration in teaching practices, and the nature of professional development provided. Our results indicated substantial intra- and inter-country variance, with U.S. and Colombian educators reporting higher familiarity and usage compared to those from Germany and Macau. Additionally, university and high school teachers were more likely to access professional development and leverage GenAI for tasks like assessment and differentiation than elementary or middle school educators, regardless of geographic setting. These disparities align with broader trends in AI adoption, reflecting heterogeneity in cultural attitudes, systemic barriers, and institutional support. Our findings highlight the critical need for targeted strategies that mitigate these emerging gaps in AI literacy, competency, and professional development.

AB  - Middle School students in the United States are exposed to an unprecedented number of AI-driven consumer products. This exposure demands that educators help students develop their personal understandings of these technologies to engage with them responsibly. Designing age-appropriate AI curricula for middle school students calls for collaboration and partnership between computer and learning scientists, as well as middle school teachers. Over a 3-year period, we co-designed and successfully implemented an AI education curriculum across 9 geographically and economically diverse schools, offering it to a total of 1551 students. Drawing from our analyses of the curriculum and teacher and student experiences, we propose an effective format for teaching, assessing, and implementing fundamental AI education for middle school settings in the United States. Our research also highlights the value of empowering teachers through co-design; enriching their professional development and improving students’ AI literacy.

AB  - As artificial intelligence (AI) became a part of daily life, it has become important to determine user competence in using AI technology. Here, we propose the concept of AI literacy and develop a quantitative scale for obtaining accurate data regarding the AI literacy of ordinary users. We first identified the primary core constructs of AI literacy, including awareness, use, evaluation, and ethics. Next, we generated 65 items to capture these four constructs; only 31 items were retained after a three-step content validation process. Then, we conducted a survey, and collected two samples of data. By reducing the number of items using the first sample and performing reliability and validity tests on the second sample, we obtained a 12-item instrument for the quantitative measurement of AI literacy. The results confirmed that the proposed four-construct model is an adequate representation of AI literacy. Further, AI literacy is significantly related to digital literacy, attitude towards robots, and users' daily usage of AI. This study will not only aid researchers in understanding how user competence in using AI technology affects human–AI interactions but will also help designers develop AI applications that are aligned with the AI literacy levels of the target users.

AB  - In the early 2000s, Kurt Fischer and colleagues founded the Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) field (Blake &amp; Gardner, 2007; Fischer &amp; Bidell, 2006), including a flagship journal, society (International Mind, Brain, Education Society [IMBES]), and a master's degree program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (Harvard). The MBE program was the first-of-its-kind, focused on the intersection of neurobiology, psychology, and educational research and practice (Blake &amp; Gardner, 2007; Fischer, 2009). Between its first cohort in 2004 and its final cohort in 2022, the program graduated 668 students from around the world (see Figure 1). Contemporaneously, scholars developed MBE or related Educational Neuroscience initiatives in several US states, Canada, the United Kingdom, Austria, The Netherlands, China, Israel, across Latin America, and other locations around the world. A central question in education revolves around what instructional approaches work for whom and under which conditions. MBE seeks to address these inquiries by leveraging cross-disciplinary methods and frameworks with rigorous scientific precision. Yet, the progression of scientific knowledge is often limited by the tools at hand. Herein lies one of the most significant contributions of MBE: It acts as a catalyst for methodological innovation, highlighting the limitations of current scientific approaches in tackling some of the most pressing educational challenges. The need to model the complex probabilistic relations that underlie educational response propelled innovation in the application of sophisticated computational techniques to highly dimensional student data. To illustrate, in a recent study, we used machine learning (ML) to improve methods of prediction of instructional responses in first-grade students at risk for reading disabilities (Shangguan et al., 2023; Zhongkai et al., Under Review). Due to challenges such as incomplete data from young participants, our initial ML models struggled to forecast student outcomes accurately. It wasn't until we integrated methods adapted from the fields of natural language processing and computer vision that we saw a significant uptick in accuracy. We trained our models to recognize hidden patterns between known and unknown data points, resulting in an enhanced out-of-sample prediction accuracy of 80%. In another example, innovative ML was applied to video recordings of math lessons to identify what teacher discourse features were important for supporting a positive learning mindset in students (Hunkins, Kelly, &amp; D'Mello, 2022). In a different domain, the need for more ecologically valid neuroimaging to measure how cognitive and neural processes that underlie learning unfold in naturalistic settings, has facilitated the optimization of portable neuroimaging methods across a diverse range of contexts. For example, portable electroencephalography has been used to study student engagement during live classroom instruction (Davidesco, Matuk, Bevilacqua, Poeppel, &amp; Dikker, 2021; Landi et al., 2019), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy has been used to document neural signatures of reading development in children growing in environments with a high risk of illiteracy, rural Côte d'Ivoire (Jasińska &amp; Guei, 2018). The implementation of portable neuroimaging in these settings posed methodological challenges, and the response to those challenges fostered innovation. In-school EEG data collection is noisy, so the team has leveraged high-density EEG tools, which capture thousands of data points per second, combined with ML classifiers, to dissociate signal from noise. This allowed for a more precise characterization of individual differences in the neural substrates of reading as they unfold during instruction (Davidesco et al., 2021; Landi et al., 2019). To address the challenges of setting up a portable neuroimaging laboratory in low-resource contexts, researchers developed comprehensive protocols addressing problems such as high humidity and lack of Internet access (Jasińska &amp; Guei, 2018). The advancement of these portable neuroimaging methods and the emergence of additional technologies, such as portable magnetic resonance imaging, can enable more equitable access to neuroimaging technologies around the world. Over the past 20 years, the MBE field has facilitated the expansion of empirical, translational, and policy-relevant work through a breadth of opportunities to bridge the mind, brain, and education sciences. Using mostly lab-based cognitive neuroscience approaches (but see Janssen et al., 2021), educational neuroscience researchers have examined the cognitive and neural bases of school-relevant skills. Not meant to impact the classroom directly, this research has elucidated the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie learning, such as basic processes in numerical cognition (Pollack &amp; Price, 2019, 2020), the relation between math and reading (Pollack et al., 2021; Pollack &amp; Ashby, 2018), and the connection of both with executive functioning (Marks et al., 2023). Connecting to classroom learning, MBE work has advanced understandings of education challenges across levels of analysis. For example, MBE work has evidenced the deleterious biological and psychological effects of racial/ethnic discrimination and how they undermine student performance and opportunities to thrive (Levy, Heissel, Richeson, &amp; Adam, 2016; Shonkoff, Slopen, &amp; Williams, 2021), and translated research for myriad education stakeholders (The Learning Scientists, 2023; https://bold.expert/). MBE's interdisciplinary approach has also informed policy. A synthesis of convergent evidence from biology, psychology, and education shows that adolescents benefit from starting school later (Watson et al., 2017), which provided strong evidence for California's 2022 implementation of later middle and high school start times (SB-328 Pupil Attendance: School Start Time, 2019). Alongside the expansion of MBE research, additional training and career development opportunities support the field's expansion, including the 2017 establishment of the IMBES Trainee Board by early career scholars (Gotlieb et al., 2019). The international proliferation of programs and centers (e.g., University of Alabama, Vanderbilt University, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, University of Graz, East China Normal University, University College London) has made joining the community easier. I am particularly enthusiastic about the field's potential moving forward. MBE stakeholders can expand research-practice partnership opportunities, emphasize learning from educational practice, and further increase access and representation in the questions we ask and who may answer them. Educators have long been aware of a simple fact: sparking a child's curiosity will help them learn (Deci &amp; Ryan, 1981). Developmental psychologists have suggested that children's insatiable wonder is a critical drive in cognition that supports intuitive theory building and scientific reasoning (Gopnik, 2016; Keil, 2022; Schulz, 2012). Robotics, ML, and artificial general intelligence researchers have begun to build models with "curiosity" rewards to bootstrap learning (see Haber, 2022 for recent review). Psychological and computational theories link it to our need to resolve uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps (Gottlieb, Oudeyer, Lopes, &amp; Baranes, 2013; Loewenstein, 1994). But until recently, formalizing exactly what curiosity is and how it relates directly to learning and the brain has remained less well understood (Kidd &amp; Hayden, 2015). One of the most exciting developments in MBE has been new brain measures that might "tap into" and even provide explanation for the function and mechanisms underlying our drive to resolve uncertainty. In particular, EEG studies (measuring the electrical signals in the brain) have revealed several important connections between the theta oscillation brain signal and behavior: theta oscillations are involved in memory formation and reward; they are predictive of learning success; and, even in infancy, they are heightened preceding events that are predicted to reveal new information (see Begus &amp; Bonawitz, 2020 for review). Such measures allow us to decouple previously confounded measures of curiosity and learning, such as the child's exploration (which can be influenced by factors beyond curiosity) and information gathered (which affects the inferences that can be drawn). We can then also understand how the child's current beliefs and preceding experiences (e.g., established knowledge, goals, and rapport with a teacher, see Bonawitz &amp; Shafto, 2016) affect a learner's expectation of information and curiosity. And we can study more precisely how brain measures that might reflect curiosity then relate to attention, memory, and learning. Such explanatory models will allow us to understand better how to support curiosity in all learners. It is a very exciting time, as we are just at the precipice of building causal, theory-driven models of the role of curiosity in the mind and brain for education. Since the early 2000s, the field of MBE has continued to provide novel insights and perspectives across research-practice-clinic settings. The power of this research has been showcased in how we conceptualize learning differences, reading acquisition, and brain plasticity. With a focus on learning disabilities or difficulties, I draw on the example of dyslexia, a common reading disability that impacts the accuracy and/or fluency of single-word reading (Lyon et al., 2001; Lyon et al., 2003). One of the earliest contributions of cognitive neuroscience research was in establishing that dyslexia was indeed "neurobiological in origin," in that brain signatures for reading differ between groups of readers with and without dyslexia. Although seemingly elemental, this insight continues to act as a framework essential in reframing attribution for the difficulties faced by struggling readers (i.e., it was not based on laziness, limited aptitude, etc. as many continue to believe; Cortiella &amp; Horowitz, 2014; Horowitz, Rawe, &amp; Whittaker, 2017). Furthermore, the accumulated evidence that the "reading brain" is plastic, and changes in ways specific to the reading programs used (Eden et al., 2004; Yoncheva, Wise, &amp; McCandliss, 2015), has redoubled the importance of providing evidence-based reading instruction to developing readers. MBE research has also converged with theories of learning (e.g., dynamic skills theory; Fischer &amp; Bidell, 2006) to reveal that skill acquisition is dynamic, with the impact of reading instruction differing by student and environmental characteristics, as well as by academic calendar phases (i.e., during summer vacation; Romeo et al., 2018; Meisler et al., 2023). Insights from studies on reading abilities among individuals with distinct neural architecture (e.g., relying on a single hemisphere as a consequence of epilepsy-related surgery) have likewise emphasized the resilience of students and the multiple pathways to reading progress (Christodoulou et al., 2021; Katzir, Christodoulou, &amp; DeBode, 2017). Across these types of contributions, MBE has advanced how we conceptualize learning and teaching. Looking ahead, MBE can harness the vast foundational knowledge now established to explore more complex and nuanced studies of children in contexts (e.g., examining the interactions of who a child is with what is being asked and in what context). Another potential for innovation is advancing toward MBE research that shifts away from group-based inquiries to individual differences models. Most importantly, MBE research will matter in the future when it is disseminated effectively, in a manner inclusive and representative of our populations of interest, and meaningful for the communities we serve as scientists. When the MBE field started to emerge, it had a number of bold ideas and hypotheses. For example, people were excited about the prospect of using neuroimaging to diagnose learning differences, characterize individual learning trajectories, or as a tool to identify who will subsequently struggle with learning to read or math. Furthermore, there was excitement about a direct translation of neuroimaging findings into the classroom using "brain-based curricula." Over the last 20 years, the field has learned a lot about neuroimaging methodology and its limitations and has also started to ask more refined questions and build relationships among the various stakeholders in the scientific and educational settings. As a result, evidence-based translational knowledge and scientifically trained changemakers have emerged (Solari et al., 2020; Ansari &amp; Coch, 2006; Sheridan &amp; McLaughlin, 2022; Thomas et al., 2019; Blakemore &amp; Bunge, 2012; Gabrieli, 2016). In my opinion, the most significant impact of MBE on educational practice is at least twofold. First, we now understand that the development of academic skills and their precursors starts as early as in utero. Therefore, we need to understand a child's entire developmental trajectory (both generally and in key skills such as language and reading) in the context of variable environments to determine how, when, and where brains learn best (Ozernov-Palchik, Yu, Wang, &amp; Gaab, 2016). Second, inspired by neuroscientific evidence that brain differences underlying disorders such as developmental dyslexia are present as early as infancy (Guttorm et al., 2005; Langer et al., 2017), the idea of "preventative education" is emerging, and early identification of children at risk for atypical developmental trajectories of academic skills is starting to get embraced (Fletcher et al., 2021; Gaab &amp; Petscher, 2022; Catts &amp; Petscher, 2022; Catts &amp; Hogan, 2021; Ozernov-Palchik et al., 2016). All but 11 states in the United States have passed legislation for universal kindergarten literacy screening designed to identify children at risk for literacy-based disabilities (https://improvingliteracy.org/state-of-dyslexia). Education needs to continue to move from a reactive model to a proactive model, similar to shifts that happened in other fields that led to impactful practices such as preventative medicine (e.g., mammograms for breast cancer detection, Duffy et al., 2020). The field of MBE began with great excitement as modern neuroimaging techniques allowed for visualization and measurement of the brain bases of learning, how that develops from infancy through adulthood, and how that varies in different kinds of learners. It was, and is, thrilling to view the functional and structural brain bases of learning, the essence of education. In broad terms, MBE embraced the idea that, where possible, understanding and improving educational outcomes needs to be fueled by scientific evidence. For centuries, the understanding of the brain bases of learning was informed only by the study of adults with focal brain injuries. Now a neuroscience perspective could be brought directly to children and their developing brains, and to many aspects of education and learning, from reading to math and to broader cognitive skills, like executive functions, and social-emotional functions that support all kinds of learning. A change over time is that neuroimaging research has broadened its perspective from a focus on specific learning differences to consider also differences related to environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status, that have such broad impacts on education outcomes and opportunities (Mackey et al., 2015). One significant contribution of MBE was that powerful evidence became available for the brain bases of learning differences, such as dyslexia. Diversity among children's brains can make various aspects of learning to read easier or harder. Indeed, such differences are now documented for risk for dyslexia from infancy (Yu et al., 2022) through the start of school (Saygin et al., 2013) and for dyslexia through the years of schooling into adulthood. Further, the identification of differences in pre-readers opened up opportunities for early support that prevent severe struggles. Neuroimaging also revealed brain plasticity associated with helpful educational practices, which further supported the importance of such practices. In some cases, neuroimaging outperformed typical education measures in predicting future improvement in reading among children with dyslexia (Hoeft et al., 2011). The idea that brain measures, in combination with typical education measures, could help identify which student is most likely to benefit from alternative supports opens the possibility of more effective individualized education. The MBE field has had a profound and positive impact on education for neurodiverse students and their families. A learning difference diagnosis can describe a student's challenges, but it can also be perceived as overly prescriptive, limiting the potential for a student's future academic success. Neuroimaging studies have revealed that children with learning differences recruit alternative pathways and develop compensatory strategies to achieve success in the domain in which they are impaired (Yu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2023). For students with diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or dyslexia, this idea that learning involves many concurrent processes is empowering: Even if a student faces some challenges, they can rely on other strengths and capabilities to find success. In my work as an educator, I have used the MBE approach as a tool for combating misleading claims about learning and the brain. As a music teacher, I have used my MBE background to help parents overcome misleading information about music and child development (like the so-called "Mozart effect") and instead provide more reliable insights about how early music exposure can help young children's developing speech and language (Tierney &amp; Kraus, 2013; Zhao &amp; Kuhl, 2016). With its focus on applying scientific evidence to inform educational practice, MBE helps educators to be more discerning consumers and effective stewards of information about learning and the brain. As an education funder for a global philanthropic organization, Porticus (2023), I have the privilege of learning from many nonprofit leaders, practitioners, public policymakers, and the like. From this bird's-eye view, I've witnessed a shifting interest in incorporating the learning and developmental sciences—the crux of MBE—into practice and policy. Perhaps the most revolutionizing contribution from MBE to the education sector has been an evidence-based understanding of the conditions required to support learning. Organizations like Turnaround for Children (https://turnaroundusa.org) convey the clear science that all children are born with brains that are ready to learn, that learning depends on conditions in the environment, and that we must design care and educational settings that enable children to thrive (Jensen et al., 2021; Troller-Renfree et al., 2022; Troller-Renfree et al., 2023). A sense of belonging, safe environment, supportive relationships, and a holistic approach to building student skills, mindsets, and autonomy are fundamental to learning (Caballero et al., 2019). The resources published by networks such as the Science of Learning and Development Alliance (2023) are critical to translating these scientific principles into actionable guides for implementation, like the Design Principles (Learning Policy Institute &amp; Turnaround for Children, 2021). What excites me most is seeing these tenets being implemented in pockets across the globe. NGOs have been thought leaders in bridging the knowledge-practice gap. For instance, in addition to Turnaround, Transcend Education (https://transcendeducation.org) uses a community-driven R&amp;D model to build school environments with evidence-based design and practices. These organizations and others are working with districts across the country, such as Washington DC Public Schools, to redesign systems with contextualized MBE principles embedded within their core operations. MBE has made a lasting contribution to education with the research-supported Universal Design for Learning framework (UDL; Rose &amp; Meyer, 2002). UDL emphasizes diverse populations; it offers actionable guidelines for enacting change and the optimal design of educational experiences for all. UDL has permeated education practice and policy (e.g., Higher Education Opportunity Act, 2008; Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 2004) and influenced the design and implementation of educational materials, including curricula for Artificial Intelligence (AI) education (Walsh et al., 2022). The AI for K-12 initiative (AI4K12) highlights considerations for AI technology in education, such as biases in data that AI models use for training, issues of equity in AI, and societal impacts (Touretzky, Gardner-McCune, Martin, &amp; Seehorn, 2019). In response, designers, researchers, and stakeholders use the UDL framework to make curricular materials accessible and engaging (Walsh &amp; Dalton, 2022). In codesigning learning activities for an inclusive AI literacy curriculum, Responsible AI for Computational Action (https://raise.mit.edu/research-projects/inclusive-ai-literacy-learning/), I witnessed special needs teachers on the research team and field-based teacher partners cite UDL in their curriculum modifications, for example, the UDL principle of multiple modes of expression. Teacher partners modified a module in which students redesign a space and incorporate AI technology in an all-digital format to allow students to build physical miniature models of their envisioned room, which would help students articulate their designs and thoughts. UDL's translation from the research base to practical, actionable guidelines can facilitate the wide adoption of brain-science-informed learning design decisions among educators. As MBE evolves, we should celebrate its progress and continue to expand its mainstream adoption through the translation of cutting-edge research into practical applications and frameworks. Such translation can facilitate practitioners' and designers' uptake of these advancements, ultimately enhancing the inclusivity and equity of educational programs. In the last few years, I have observed a growing interest among educators (in North America and beyond) seeking knowledge on child development through cognitive neuroscience, focusing on mechanisms underlying behavioral outcomes. From early childhood education to college learning, schools often become children and adolescents' "second home" where they spend an extended amount of time. Educators and schools are active agents in shaping not only children's learning outcomes, but also their development. I had the pleasure of working with several educators who actively contributed to informing and designing our experiments. Furthermore, many of the doctoral students I worked with at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) were teachers and educators, creating synergetic collaborations merging their professional experiences with research. Personally, as a researcher engaging in both cognitive neuroscience and education research relating to multilingualism, embracing the MBE approach has changed me to be a better learner and listener. By spending time talking to educators at the state-, district-, and school-levels as a cognitive neuroscience researcher of language, I learned about their challenges and achievements from practitioner and policymaking perspectives. By observing Head Start classrooms and interacting with parents and educators, I listened to their concerns and gained a grounded perspective on child development. These voices enriched the way my research is framed and designed. For example, the shift from viewing multilingualism as a homogeneous group in state-level data (Luk &amp; Kroll, 2019; Mancilla-Martinez, Oh, Luk, &amp; Rollins, 2022; Yamasaki &amp; Luk, 2018), and the shift to focus on outcomes to process and individual language experiences (Leon Guerrero, Whitford, Mesite, &amp; Luk, 2021; Luk, 2022; Smith, Leon Guerrero, Surrain, &amp; Luk, 2021) facilitate the understanding of learning mechanisms, which informs pedagogical strategies in linguistically diverse classrooms. I see the next stage of MBE being a two-way street, bringing researchers and stakeholders of education together, centering on child development and learning, and synergistically enriching scholarly knowledge, pedagogical practice, and educational policy. MBE-minded researchers, practitioners, and policymakers situated in different contexts aim to improve children's well-being by investing in MBE collaborations and synergy to transform cognitive neuroscience to be ecologically meaningful and relevant. Over the past two decades, I have witnessed an eagerness among educators to learn more about the brain and brain development and to explore how knowledge of brain development can inform the field of education. Embedded within this is a curiosity about how one studies human brain development and thus, an interest in learning more about the broad field of neuroimaging. In terms of what most excites me, several things come to mind. First, there have been major advances in our understanding of errors in brain development that lead to children struggling to learn to read (dyslexia; Norton, Beach, &amp; Gabrieli, 2015), to master mathematics (dyscalculia; De Smedt, Peters, &amp; Ghesquière, 2019), and to communicate socially (autism; Willsey &amp; State, 2015). These errors can be genetic (e.g., single gene disorders such as Rett Syndrome or Fragile X Syndrome) or environmental (e.g., children experiencing profound neglect early in life, such as those abandoned in orphanages McLaughlin, Sheridan, &amp; Nelson, 2017). For example, in one study, my colleagues and I demonstrated the causal effects of the caregiving environment on children's stress response during academic-like tasks (e.g., mental arithmetic; McLaughlin et al., 2015). Second, advances in neuroimaging have increasingly allowed us to identify children at risk for developmental disorders very early in life (e.g., work on the development of biomarkers that can be used as objective "readouts" of atypical development, before behavioral readouts become reliable). For example, across multiple studies, we found that atypicalities in brain function in infants can facilitate earlier identification of autism spectrum disorder (Bosl, Tager-Flusberg, &amp; Nelson, 2018; Peck et al., 2021). MBE as a field has evolved considerably, and there continues to be a lot to be excited about! There have been substantial advancements in mechanistic descriptions of typical and disordered development across domains such as reading, mathematics, creativity, and social communication. Furthermore, MBE research has generated complementary neurobiological evidence in support of educational policies and practices, such as preventative universal literacy screening and a later school start time, to optimize learning and healthy development across the life span. While MBE has achieved notable progress in its two-decade existence, it continues to strive to fulfill its foundational promise of enhancing precision in risk identification, outcome prediction, and individualized education (Gabrieli, 2016). In closing this paper, we distill the insights from the individual contributions into three main challenges hindering MBE's influence on educational practice and policy: (1) inter-individual heterogeneity, (2) limited generalizability, and (3) gaps in the implementation of scientific evidence. We include some hopeful developments for addressing these challenges. For neuroscience to advance education, it is critical to understand how the nervous system relates to behavior by examining the associations between measures of the brain and variation in some behavior. Measures of brain and behavior, however, are complex, with multiple factors that influence their reliability (Elliott et al., 2020, ; Noble, Scheinost, &amp; Constable, 2019; Zorowitz &amp; Niv, 2023). Consequently, brain-behavior associations yield very small effect sizes and require enormous sample sizes (in the thousands!) to detect these effects reliably (Marek et al., 2022). To address issues of optimizing sample sizes and increasing reliability, the field has been moving toward multi-lab collaborations, resulting in consortia with thousands of participants (e.g., Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study; Volkow et al., 2018) and in-depth multi-session characterization of individuals using precision neuroimaging approaches (Grotton et al., 2022). These approaches will enable a comprehensive understanding of how the brain is related to behavior. The application of research findings across populations is critical for the advancement of knowledge, and in turn for the application of findings to diverse communities. As evident in the examples highlighted in the current paper, most MBE studies to date have been conducted in non-naturalistic lab settings, under tightly controlled conditions, and on nonrepresentative WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic; Henrich et al., 2010) populations. There has been a shift toward increased focus on engaging and training diverse communities in research and transitioning research from labs to schools and communities. Such efforts are necessary to establish the boundaries of generalizability of findings and determine what is true for what populations. Finally, the adoption of evidence-based practices in education has been impeded, in part, by a paucity of knowledge regarding factors that affect their implementation and sustainability in educational settings. Currently, there is an intensified focus on pinpointing the components of specific programs, discerning the barriers and facilitators across various educational contexts, understanding the structural characteristics of the participating institutions, and evaluating the individual factors of those targeted and those implementing the program, crucial for successful implementation and sustainability. Drawing from this work, the field has increasingly emphasized engagement in equitable and sustainable research collaborations with educators.

N1  - C. Highlights. 
N1  - C1. EEG studies have revealed several important connections between the theta oscillation brain signal and behavior: theta oscillations are involved in memory formation and reward; they are predictive of learning success; and, even in infancy, they are heightened preceding events that are predicted to reveal new information.

N1  - E14. Reflections On MBE. 
N1  - E15. The Mind, Brain, and Education (MBE) field has evolved significantly over the past two decades, with contributions from various disciplines, including neurobiology, psychology, and educational research and practice (Blake &amp; Gardner, 2007; Fischer &amp; Bidell, 2006).. 
N1  - E16. The MBE program at Harvard Graduate School of Education, which graduated 668 students from around the world between 2004 and 2022, has played a crucial role in advancing the field.. 
N1  - E17. Methodological Innovation. 
N1  - E18. One of the significant contributions of MBE is its role as a catalyst for methodological innovation.. 
N1  - E19. The field has driven the development of sophisticated computational techniques, such as machine learning (ML), to tackle complex educational challenges (Shangguan et al, Under Review).. 
N1  - E20. The integration of methods from natural language processing and computer vision has improved the accuracy of predicting student outcomes (Shangguan et al, Under Review).. 
N1  - E21. Additionally, portable neuroimaging methods, such as electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy, have been optimized for use in diverse contexts, enabling more ecologically valid measurements of cognitive and neural processes (Davidesco et al, 2021; Landi et al, 2019; Jasińska &amp; Guei, 2018).. 
N1  - E22. Impact On Educational Practice. 
N1  - E23. MBE has had a significant impact on educational practice, with research informing policy and practice across various levels of analysis.. 
N1  - E24. For example, MBE work has evidenced the deleterious effects of racial/ethnic discrimination on student performance and opportunities to thrive (Levy et al, 2016; Shonkoff et al, 2021).. 
N1  - E25. The field has also informed policy, such as the implementation of later school start times in California (SB-328 Pupil Attendance: School Start Time, 2019).. 
N1  - E26. Furthermore, MBE has advanced understandings of education challenges, including the cognitive and neural bases of school-relevant skills, and has translated research for various education stakeholders (The Learning Scientists, 2023; https://bold.expert/).. 
N1  - E27. Impact Of MBE On Education. 
N1  - E28. The most significant impact of MBE on educational practice is twofold: understanding that the development of academic skills starts as early as in utero, and the idea of "preventative education" is emerging, with early identification of children at risk for atypical developmental trajectories of academic skills (Ozernov-Palchik et al, 2016; Fletcher et al, 2021; Gaab &amp; Petscher, 2022; Catts &amp; Petscher, 2022; Catts &amp; Hogan, 2021).. 
N1  - E29. Education needs to continue to move from a reactive model to a proactive model, similar to shifts that happened in other fields that led to impactful practices such as preventative medicine (Duffy et al, 2020).. 
N1  - E30. Neuroimaging And Learning Differences. 
N1  - E31. Neuroimaging research has broadened its perspective from a focus on specific learning differences to consider also differences related to environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status, that have such broad impacts on education outcomes and opportunities (Mackey et al, 2015).. 
N1  - E32. Powerful evidence became available for the brain bases of learning differences, such as dyslexia, and neuroimaging also revealed brain plasticity associated with helpful educational practices (Yu et al, 2022; Saygin et al, 2013; Hoeft et al, 2011).. 
N1  - E33. MBE And Educational Practice. 
N1  - E34. The MBE approach has been used to combat misleading claims about learning and the brain, and to provide more reliable insights about how early music exposure can help young children's developing speech and language (Tierney &amp; Kraus, 2013; Zhao &amp; Kuhl, 2016).. 
N1  - E35. MBE has made a lasting contribution to education with the research-supported Universal Design for Learning framework (UDL; Rose &amp; Meyer, 2002), which emphasizes diverse populations and offers actionable guidelines for enacting change and the optimal design of educational experiences for all.. 
N1  - E36. Advances In MBE. 
N1  - E37. MBE has made significant progress in understanding typical and disordered development across various domains, including reading, mathematics, creativity, and social communication (Gabrieli, 2016).. 
N1  - E38. Advances in neuroimaging have enabled the identification of children at risk for developmental disorders early in life, such as autism spectrum disorder (Bosl, Tager-Flusberg, &amp; Nelson, 2018; Peck et al, 2021).. 
N1  - E39. Additionally, MBE research has generated evidence in support of educational policies and practices, such as preventative universal literacy screening and a later school start time, to optimize learning and healthy development across the life span.. 
N1  - E40. Challenges In MBE. 
N1  - E41. Despite the progress made, MBE faces three main challenges hindering its influence on educational practice and policy: (1) inter-individual heterogeneity, (2) limited generalizability, and (3) gaps in the implementation of scientific evidence.. 
N1  - E42. These challenges are due to the complexity of brain-behavior associations, which yield small effect sizes and require large sample sizes to detect reliably (Marek et al, 2022).. 
N1  - E43. Furthermore, most MBE studies have been conducted in non-naturalistic lab settings, on nonrepresentative WEIRD populations, and with limited focus on implementation and sustainability in educational settings.. 
N1  - E44. Future Directions. 
N1  - E45. To address these challenges, the field is moving toward multi-lab collaborations, precision neuroimaging approaches, and increased focus on engaging and training diverse communities in research (Grotton et al, 2022; Volkow et al, 2018).. 
N1  - E46. There is also an intensified focus on pinpointing the components of specific programs, discerning the barriers and facilitators across various educational contexts, and evaluating the individual factors of those targeted and those implementing the program, crucial for successful implementation and sustainability.

AB  - Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into teaching practices is increasingly vital for preparing students for a technology-centric future. This study examined the influence of a case-based AI professional development (PD) program on AI integration strategies and AI literacy among seven middle school science teachers. Employing three distinct case problems, from well-structured to ill-structured, the AI PD program aimed to stimulate teachers' reflection on AI literacy development and encourage the construction of problem-solving and AI integration strategies within various pedagogical contexts. Analysis of video-recorded case discussions revealed that teachers primarily drew on personal experiences for collaborative problem-solving across the three cases. However, the complexity of the case problems influenced their approach to knowledge co-construction, and dealing with ill-structured problems promoted the application of new knowledge. Through analyzing the survey data, we found a marked increase in teachers' AI literacy, particularly in the domain of knowing and understanding AI, suggesting a pivotal role for direct instruction that supports AI literacy growth. However, their application of this AI knowledge was limited during the case discussions, while other domains of teacher AI literacy were more frequently employed. The findings highlight the importance of combining direct instruction with case-based discussions in AI-related PD programs to bolster teacher AI literacy effectively. The research has implications for using a case-based learning approach during short-term PD initiatives and advocates the ongoing need for comprehensive AI literacy development to facilitate teachers' AI integration in subject-specific teaching.

AB  - Objectives This study has developed teaching strategies that instructors can use to design and implement artificial intelligence convergence education utilizing generative artificial intelligence for image creation. The derived lesson designs and teaching strategies suggest a limited use of artificial intelligence to ensure that learners using generative AI do not lose their creative autonomy. Methods Through a review of prior literature, an initial checklist for class design and a teaching strategy were developed. Subsequently, two rounds of internal validation were conducted with four experts. A creative class utilizing image-generating artificial intelligence was then implemented for 100 first-year middle school students in Seoul. The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated through pre- and post-tests of artificial intelligence literacy and interviews with the learners. Results Ultimately, 10 items for the class design checklist and 51 items for the teaching strategy were developed. The class design checklist included steps for ‘checking the usage environment’, ‘evaluating the class content’, and ‘assessing expertise’. The teaching strategy was structured into stages of ‘class preparation’, ‘understanding image-generating artificial intelligence’, ‘creative problem-solving’, and ‘class arrangement’. As a result of implementing these creative classes with image-generating artificial intelligence, there was a significant improvement in the students’ artificial intelligence literacy. Furthermore, both instructors and learners highlighted several benefits of these classes, such as the integration of artificial intelligence with various subjects, the enhancement of divergent thinking, firsthand experience with artificial intelligence principles and applications, opportunities for collaboration and discussion, and a strengthened understanding of copyright and ethical considerations. Conclusions The instructional class design checklist and teaching strategy developed in this study serve as cross-curricular guidelines applicable to various subjects that involve image creation, including Korean language, history, and art. Designing artificial intelligence convergence lessons with a focus on protecting learner’s creative autonomy can enable them to grasp the entire creative process and its inherent value. This approach goes beyond mere technical use, empowering learners to enhance their own creative expressions.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of this study is multifold: First, to develop an educational program using artificial intelligence (AI) in middle school free semester system of South Korea. Second, to verify the program’s effectiveness, the study clarified the definition of AI and AI education and considered their meaning in technology education. This study used three steps: preparation, development, and improvement. In the preparation step, this study set the theme and purpose of the AI program and selected the free semester activity type “theme selection activity.” After analyzing the technology curriculum and extracting AI-related elements in the development step, this study laid out the program for 16 h of class time. In the improvement step, to augment the program’s validity, the researcher revised and supplemented it as a whole through expert consultation. This research differentiated the developed program from the AI education program of other subjects and specialized it, focusing on the specificity of technology education. The study emphasized the social impact of the latest technology, ethics of AI, physical computing using AI, and technological problem-solving activity using AI. The final developed program was applied to the students, and students participated in a pretest and posttest. The study used the PATT and AI competency test tools. The PATT results showed a significant increase in the mean of both constructs in “interest in technology” and “career aspirations in technology.” In AI competency, the mean of two constructs increased significantly in “social impact of AI” and “AI performance.” In particular, “AI performance” showed the largest increase. There was no statistically significant change in “interaction with AI.” The study results confirmed that the developed AI program was effective in technology education and career exploration, which is the primary purpose of the free semester. In addition, it was possible to confirm the technology educational value of the AI education program centered on technological problem-solving. These research results have implications for bringing AI into technology education.

N1  - E14. Objectives. 
N1  - E15. The study measured the effectiveness of AI education programs in technology education, attitudes toward technology, and AI-related competencies. The two objectives of the study are:. 
N1  - E16. Background. 
N1  - E17. The Ministry of Education in South Korea implemented a nationwide free semester and free year system in 2016 to emphasize career education and provide students with career experience (Ministry of Education, 2015a).. 
N1  - E18. Despite good intentions, there are critical differences of opinion between the Ministry of Education and the Office of Education, teachers in the field, and students, leading to difficulties in implementing the free semester system (Shin et al, 2015; Shin et al, 2018).. 
N1  - E19. Technology education is a subject with many areas that can be dealt with according to each one's characteristics, but research on theme selection activity and career education in the free semester is insufficient (Kim, 2017).. 
N1  - E20. Artificial Intelligence Education. 
N1  - E21. The current government in South Korea is actively promoting artificial intelligence (AI)-related industry and education (Government, 2019).. 
N1  - E22. The Ministry of Education created various AI and associated subjects in the 2022 revised curriculum for application starting in 2025 (Ministry of Education, 2020).. 
N1  - E23. Research on systematically applying AI and machine learning in education is insufficient (Tedre et al, 2021).. 
N1  - E24. Teachers recognize the necessity of integrating AI into the problem-solving process with other subjects, but there is a lack of education and support for field teachers or preservice teachers, creating a gap between policy and field atmosphere (Kim &amp; Han, 2020).. 
N1  - E25. Study Objectives And Methodology. 
N1  - E26. The study developed an AI program that can be applied immediately by technology teachers teaching the free semester, measuring its effectiveness after application with students..

N1  - E36. AI Education Research. 
N1  - E37. Researchers are actively conducting studies in AI-related fields, such as "computational thinking" and "SW competency," reflecting competency-based evaluation (Choi, 2019).. 
N1  - E38. AI-related research has only recently emerged as a research topic, and investigation of the definition and evaluation of AI competency is insufficient (Min &amp; Shim, 2021).. 
N1  - E39. Studies on education methods using AI tools and AI education in STEM are underway, but the number of studies in technology subjects is small.. 
N1  - E40. Methodology. 
N1  - E41. The researcher conducted a pretest and posttest to measure students' attitudes toward technology and AI competency.. 
N1  - E42. The study piloted the test tool on 200 first-year middle school students to verify its reliability.. 
N1  - E43. The PATT tool, developed by Bame et al (1993), was used to measure students' attitudes toward technology, with a reliability of 0.930.. 
N1  - E44. The AI competency test, which measured four constructs, had a reliability of 0.812, but one construct was excluded due to low reliability.. 
N1  - E45. The study used a normalization test to examine normality, but most constructs showed normality less than 0.05, so a nonparametric test was conducted.. 
N1  - E46. Program Development. 
N1  - E47. The study developed a middle school AI education theme selection activity for technology education in the free semester.. 
N1  - E48. The program was developed using the three steps of "preparation, development, and improvement" suggested by Mager and Beach (1967).. 
N1  - E49. The researcher modified and applied each step according to the purpose of the study..

N1  - E58. The program consisted of 16 hours of instruction, covering topics such as AI basics, social impact of AI, data relating to AI, AI ethics, and AI-based problem-solving.. 
N1  - E59. The program was designed to improve AI competencies and attitudes toward technology.. 
N1  - E60. Effectiveness Of The Program. 
N1  - E61. The study found that the program was effective in improving attitudes toward technology and AI competencies.. 
N1  - E62. The results showed a significant increase in "interest in technology" and "career aspirations in technology" constructs.. 
N1  - E63. Additionally, the program improved AI competencies, particularly in "social impact of AI" and "AI performance" constructs.. 
N1  - E64. Significance And Limitations. 
N1  - E65. The study's significance lies in bringing AI into technology education and confirming the value of the AI free semester program for implementation in technology education.. 
N1  - E66. However, the study's limitations include a small sample size and short duration, which suggest the need for further research with a larger sample size and longer duration.. 
N1  - E67. Methodology And Limitations. 
N1  - E68. The study had a small sample size of 23 participants, which limited the generalizability of the results.. 
N1  - E69. Therefore, future studies should include more participants to improve the study's generalizability (Park &amp; Kwon, 2024).. 
N1  - E70. Curriculum Development.

AB  - Although artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important in the media environment (search engines, chatbots, home assistants, recommendation systems, etc.), the general audiences’ knowledge of it remains limited, which biases their representations. To compensate for this, some governments show an interest in teaching it from an early age. It appears that educational resources related to AI literacy in schools are most often focused on technical skills. However, the challenges of such education are also ethical and societal, requiring an interdisciplinary and critical approach. This research aims at developing a 10–14 years old curriculum questioning the concept of intelligence in AI systems, and crossing computer science education and media literacy education. Through a role-playing game, the children discover the basic concepts of machine learning. Beyond their initial representations, which they become aware that they are largely fueled by the media, they can realize that an AI system is the result of design choices and that it only works within the framework that has been defined for it. Moreover, the possibility for teachers to teach the curriculum themselves in their classes is also evaluated. To this end, the curriculum was taught to 60 future trainee teachers, 70 middle school pupils, and 12 elementary pupils. Interviews were conducted also with 5 teachers who had either observed the curriculum taught by a researcher or attempted to teach it themselves. The results show that the children’s representations have evolved towards representations that are more technically correct (although incomplete), but not very oriented towards aspects that open up critical questioning. The difficulties revealed in the implementation of the critical part are due in particular to the complexity of the IT concepts to be addressed, but also to the lack of teacher training. However, the data collected seems to confirm the interest and feasibility of crossing different disciplinary approaches to address certain aspects of AI. In conclusion, in addition to the curriculum, this paper describes a theoretical model of critical citizenship education in technology that integrates approaches to computer science education and media literacy education, and gives avenues for other designers and researchers to create AI critical educational experiences for K-12 learners.

AB  - The majority of AI literacy studies have designed and developed self-reported questionnaires to assess AI learning and understanding. These studies assessed students' perceived AI capability rather than AI literacy because self-perceptions are seldom an accurate account of true measures. International assessment programs that use objective measures to assess science, mathematical, digital, and computational literacy back up this argument. Furthermore, because AI education research is still in its infancy, the current definition of AI literacy in the literature may not meet the needs of young students. Therefore, this study aims to develop and validate an AI literacy test for school students within the interdisciplinary project known as AI4future. Engineering and education researchers created and selected 25 multiple-choice questions to accomplish this goal, and school teachers validated them while developing an AI curriculum for middle schools. 2,390 students in grades 7 to 9 took the test. We used a Rasch model to investigate the discrimination, reliability, and validity of the items. The results showed that the model met the unidimensionality assumption and demonstrated a set of reliable and valid items. They indicate the quality of the test items. The test enables AI education researchers and practitioners to appropriately evaluate their AI-related education interventions.

AB  - AI technology advancement has sparked a global initiative to educate youth on AI ethics. Understanding students' prior knowledge is vital. This study explores the diverse perceptions of AI ethics among Korean middle school students using Q methodology. Four types emerged: Privacy Guardians, AI Coexistence Pursuers, AI Ethics Conservatives, and Domestic Distributive Justice Advocates. These classifications reflect the students' concerns, attitudes toward AI, and value preferences. Despite differences, there is consensus on the importance of human dignity and disagreement with the fair distribution of economic benefits of AI between countries. The findings suggest the need for tailored educational strategies based on students' perceptions to foster balanced ethical reflection.

AB  - The paper presents the most comprehensive and large-scale global study to date on how higher education students perceived the use of ChatGPT in early 2024. With a sample of 23,218 students from 109 countries and territories, the study reveals that students primarily used ChatGPT for brainstorming, summarizing texts, and finding research articles, with a few using it for professional and creative writing. They found it useful for simplifying complex information and summarizing content, but less reliable for providing information and supporting classroom learning, though some considered its information clearer than that from peers and teachers. Moreover, students agreed on the need for AI regulations at all levels due to concerns about ChatGPT promoting cheating, plagiarism, and social isolation. However, they believed ChatGPT could potentially enhance their access to knowledge and improve their learning experience, study efficiency, and chances of achieving good grades. While ChatGPT was perceived as effective in potentially improving AI literacy, digital communication, and content creation skills, it was less useful for interpersonal communication, decision-making, numeracy, native language proficiency, and the development of critical thinking skills. Students also felt that ChatGPT would boost demand for AI-related skills and facilitate remote work without significantly impacting unemployment. Emotionally, students mostly felt positive using ChatGPT, with curiosity and calmness being the most common emotions. Further examinations reveal variations in students' perceptions across different socio-demographic and geographic factors, with key factors influencing students' use of ChatGPT also being identified. Higher education institutions' managers and teachers may benefit from these findings while formulating the curricula and instructions/regulations for ChatGPT use, as well as when designing the teaching methods and assessment tools. Moreover, policymakers may also consider the findings when formulating strategies for secondary and higher education system development, especially in light of changing labor market needs and related digital skills development.

N1  - C. Highlights. 
N1  - C1. Artificial Intelligence (AI), originating in the 1950s, began as an exploration of machines mimicking human behavior and cognition [1, 2]. 
N1  - C2. Due to the lack of systematic evidence on students’ early perceptions of ChatGPT, the content of the questionnaire was developed in collaboration with international partners, focusing on the most important aspects related to ChatGPT. 
N1  - C3. Students most frequently reported using ChatGPT for brainstorming, with almost 30% (2.76), followed by using ChatGPT for summarizing long texts, which was supported by 27% of students (2.64), finding articles for research, supported by 25% of students (2.63), and writing texts, chosen by 22% of students (2.64), which is partially consistent with Chan and Hu’s [30] findings. 
N1  - C4. This discrepancy implies that while students appreciate the strengths of ChatGPT in making information easier to understand and summarizing content, they remain skeptical about its reliability and usefulness in a traditional classroom setting. 
N1  - C5. Arts and humanities students (53%), who prioritize nuanced and interpretive language, might be more critical of ChatGPT’s ability to capture the depth and subtleties of human expression. This indicates that while ChatGPT is valued for its technical prowess in certain disciplines, its perceived shortcomings in handling more abstract and subjective content limit its acceptance among students in fields that demand such capabilities. 
N1  - C6. This could be due to the greater reliance of students from low income regions on cost-effective digital tools to Higher education students’ perceptions of ChatGPT: A global study of early reactions supplement their lack of educational resources [109]. 
N1  - C7. There were fears that these systems might compromise the ethics of study and Higher education students’ perceptions of ChatGPT: A global study of early reactions mislead users with inaccurate information. 
N1  - C8. Students from arts and humanities showed the strongest inclination toward regulatory support across all settings, in the belief that ChatGPT should be subject to university and faculty ethical guidelines (57%). 
N1  - C9. Only 25% of students agreed or strongly agreed that it is easier to interact with ChatGPT than with colleagues and that the information obtained from ChatGPT is clearer than that provided by their teachers. 
N1  - C10. Higher education students’ perceptions of ChatGPT: A global study of early reactions aligning with Hu et al [137] and Xu et al [53]. 
N1  - C11. The smallest perception gap was between applied sciences and natural and life sciences students (0.06), with over 40% using ChatGPT across fields. 
N1  - C12. Ordinal logistic regression was utilized to empirically validate the impact of various factors associated with ChatGPT aspects on students’ usage patterns for specific academic tasks, those most frequently used by students, such as brainstorming, summarizing, and academic writing, as suggested by the highest mean values from the first part of the analysis. 
N1  - D. Findings. 
N1  - D1. We can summarize that the tasks for which students used ChatGPT, supported by 25% or more of the students regardless of income region, were generating new ideas, summarizing long texts concisely, and helping with research writing. 
N1  - D2. Most students also agreed that ChatGPT could increase their study efficiency (59%), enhance their learning experience (58%), improve their ability to meet assignment deadlines, improve the quality of their assignments, and facilitate completing their studies, as emphasized by 57% of students. 
N1  - D3. On the other hand, less than 40% of students in all disciplines thought that ChatGPT could help them complete their internships or improve their employability. 
N1  - D4. More than 50% of students agreed that ChatGPT has the potential to improve their AI literacy, digital communication, and digital content creation skills (Fig 18). 
N1  - D5. Less than 40% of students agreed that ChatGPT has the potential to improve interpersonal communication, decision-making skills, numeracy, native language proficiency, and critical thinking skills. 
N1  - D6. Applied sciences students viewed ChatGPT most positively, citing benefits like facilitating remote work (61%), requiring new skills (60%), changing job nature (60%), improving productivity (59%), and reducing workload (58%), but they were less positive about reducing inequality (44%), resolving skills gaps (42%), and addressing skills shortages (37%). 
N1  - D7. Social sciences students were positive about increased demand for AI-related skills (61%) and reduced skills shortages (37%) but concerned about increased inequality (49%) and job reduction (39%). 
N1  - D8. They saw improved productivity (53%) as a moderate benefit. 
N1  - D9. Arts and humanities students were optimistic about ChatGPT creating new jobs (53%), improving innovation (52%), and connecting education to the labor market (44%), but skeptical about reducing the workload (55%), resolving skill obsolescence (36%), and reducing underskilling (35%). 
N1  - D10. Natural and life sciences students were generally negative, with fewer seeing benefits like job creation (46%) and innovation improvement (48%). 
N1  - D11. The smallest perception gap was between applied sciences and natural and life sciences students (0.06), with over 40% using ChatGPT across fields. 
N1  - D12. Believed that ChatGPT would require employees to acquire new skills, while students in the upper middle income regions were facilitating remote work (61%), but students from the low income regions most frequently declared that ChatGPT reduces employee workload (64%). 
N1  - D13. The proportional odds assumption was tested using the test of parallel lines, which was significant (p &lt; 0.001) for all three estimated ordinal logistic regression models, indicating that the regression slopes differ significantly across the levels of the dependent variable for all models [147]. 
N1  - D14. Specifically, the ability to simplify complex information consistently showed significant positive effects on the frequency of using ChatGPT across all three use cases, while the ability to summarize extensive information had a significant positive impact on two of the use cases. Both factors had the most substantial impact on the frequency of using ChatGPT for summarizing (β = 0.220; p &lt; 0.001 and β = 0.402; p &lt; 0.001, respectively). 
N1  - D15.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its associated applications are ubiquitous in today’s world, making it imperative that students and their teachers understand how it works and the ramifications arising from its usage. In this study, we investigate the experiences of seven teachers following their implementation of modules from the MIT RAICA (Responsible AI for Computational Action) curriculum. Through semistructured interviews, we investigated their instructional strategies as they engaged with the AI curriculum in their classroom, how their teaching and learning beliefs about AI evolved with the curriculum as well as how those beliefs impacted their implementation of the curriculum. Our analysis suggests that the AI modules not only expanded our teachers’ knowledge in the field, but also prompted them to recognize its daily applications and their ethical and societal implications, so that they could better engage with the content they deliver to students. Teachers were able to leverage their own interdisciplinary backgrounds to creatively introduce foundational AI topics to students to maximize engagement and playful learning. Our teachers advocated their need for better external support when navigating technological resources, additional time for preparation given the novelty of the curriculum, more flexibility within curriculum timelines, and additional accommodations for students of determination. Our findings provide valuable insights for enhancing future iterations of AI literacy curricula and teacher professional development (PD) resources.

N1  - C. Highlights. 
N1  - C1. There is currently a massive proliferation of digital platforms that utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) stemming from the rapid growth of data and computational power. 
N1  - C2. We present our results around the three primary themes that emerged in the deductive coding process above: attitudes and beliefs towards AI literacy, attitudes and beliefs towards teaching and learning more generally, and recommendations proposed by teachers. 
N1  - C3. Their enthusiasm for acquiring this new knowledge stemmed from its practicality in understanding the underlying workings of ubiquitous AI-powered tools employed in their daily lives. 
N1  - C4. Designing AI literacy curriculum that is flexible and conducive to varied classroom contexts, including diverse student and teacher backgrounds is critical to ensuring its success and longterm sustainability in the classroom. 
N1  - C5. Teacher support and professional development (PD) sessions should precede the implementation of new AI curricula to ensure that teachers with no prior experience are equipped with the resources needed to comfortably deliver foundational AI knowledge. 
N1  - C6. Some teachers were apprehensive about facilitating challenging conversations about AI and its ethical implications with their students. 
N1  - C7. Preparing teachers for engaging in discussions about fears students have of traversing an unknown technical landscape would require additional PD training and examples on moderating difficult conversations in class. 
N1  - C8. This approach has been utilised in other work resulting in teachers’ increased comfort in having conversations about AI ethics as well as using AI tools [18]. 
N1  - C9. The inclusion of such materials in the Responsible AI for Computational Action (RAICA) curriculum would likely increase teachers’ competence and self-confidence in multiple areas, adding to their productivity and efficacy for students. Inclusivity is another key factor to consider when deploying AI curricula. 
N1  - C10. Hands-on and unplugged activities can increase the accessibility of the curriculum for classrooms with limited access to technology [19], allowing students to learn something about AI without programming themselves. 
N1  - C11. Our findings provide valuable insights for enhancing future iterations of AI literacy curricula and teacher professional development (PD) resources.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) education in K–12 schools is a global initiative, yet planning and executing AI education is challenging. The major frameworks are focused on identifying content and technical knowledge (AI literacy). Most of the current definitions of AI literacy for a non-technical audience are developed from an engineering perspective and may not be appropriate for K–12 education. Teacher perspectives are essential to making sense of this initiative. Literacy is about knowing (knowledge, what skills); competency is about applying the knowledge in a beneficial way (confidence, how well). They are strongly related. This study goes beyond knowledge (AI literacy), and its two main goals are to (i) define AI literacy and competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self-reflective mindsets, and (ii) propose a more comprehensive framework for K–12 AI education. These definitions are needed for this emerging and disruptive technology (e.g., ChatGPT and Sora, generative AI). We used the definitions and the basic curriculum design approaches as the analytical framework and teacher perspectives. Participants included 30 experienced AI teachers from 15 middle schools. We employed an iterative co-design cycle to discuss and revise the framework throughout four cycles. The definition of AI competency has five abilities that take confidence into account, and the proposed framework comprises five key components: technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self-reflection. We also identify five effective learning experiences to foster abilities and confidences, and suggest five future research directions: prompt engineering, data literacy, algorithmic literacy, self-reflective mindset, and empirical research.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought convenience to human lives, but its pervasive impact extends beyond individuals, affecting society as a whole. Consequently, the necessity for an AI ethics education program has become increasingly apparent. This study aims to investigate the influence of an experimental research study that developed and implemented an AI ethics education program for learners’ ethical awareness and attitude towards AI. The research methodology involved validating a model of the AI ethics education program by applying it to a group of 10 domain experts. Additionally, pre-test and post-test designs were employed with 17 middle school students as the experimental group. The same assessment was administered before and after the implementation of the AI ethics education program, and the data were analyzed using paired-sample t-tests. The findings of this study are as follows: Firstly, an AI ethics education program model was developed, incorporating key competencies such as AI literacy, critical thinking skills in AI, and AI problem-solving skills, all within the context of AI ethics. The implementation of this model was effective in the educational setting. Secondly, significant improvements were observed in the ethical awareness of middle school students across all domains after participating in the program. Thirdly, the attitudes of middle school students towards AI exhibited significant enhancements across all domains. These findings contribute to the broader field of AI ethics education by highlighting the importance of ethical awareness in AI and fostering favorable attitudes towards AI. The implications of this study are significant for the field of AI education.

AB  - “AI ethics” has become a popular term for signaling concerns with the development and application of artificial intelligence, and a hot-button issue in both academic and public discourse. The current work tends to center adult-oriented, adult-generated, and issues-based conceptions of ethics. This paper reports on an alternative model for “doing ethics” via co-design with young people, highlighting the need for students to engage in AI ethics work, especially as AI is increasingly used in their education and social lives. In particular, we focus on developing a rights-based approach, using the White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights as a starting point for redesigning core AI ethics principles and their conveyance to be accessible and relevant to young people, in collaboration with young people. In this manuscript, we describe our empirical work in a series of three studies on AI ethics teaching and learning with middle and high school students, which culminated in redesigning pieces of the AI Bill of Rights. We present lessons learned, implications for responsible AI in education from student perspectives, and conclude with our suggested principles for integrating student insight and perspectives into the ethics frameworks that guide AI applications.

N1  - C. Highlights. 
N1  - C1. We make a case for consequential youth participation in AI ethics discussions and policy-building, especially in determining and advocating for students’ rights. 
N1  - C2. We draw on our empirical work with middle and high school students to describe lessons learned from working with young people to redesign AI ethics principles. 
N1  - C3. Along with the sluggish pace of AI legislation in the United States (US) generally, it is essential that we look to efforts from beyond the US for precedent and inspiration for rights-based and other policy guidance relating to AI and young people. 
N1  - C4. There are a growing number of studies reporting on rich collaborative policy-making and ethical discussion around AI in educational settings (e.g., see Swist et al.’s 2023 paper describing “ethical co-production” through Deliberative Democracy (DD) in a higher education setting), there remains a dearth of research focusing on co-designing with students, at the elementary and secondary school level (Sarmiento &amp; Wise, 2022). 
N1  - C5. Through careful engagement with student artifacts and analysis from each case, along with our conceptual grounding in critical digital literacy and co-design research and practice as theory we are “thinking with” (Jackson &amp; Mazzei, 2012), we have developed a set of recommendations, or principles, based on our experiences in these studies that we think may be useful for guiding others’ pursuits in AI ethics education with young people. 
N1  - C6. This progression reflects the historical thread and context of this work, which builds over several iterations occurring both before and after inflection points in discourse around AI ethics, including the publication of the Blueprint and the release of ChatGPT to the public. 
N1  - C7. This work is animated by questions about AI, ethics, education, and students: What should an AI Bill of Rights for Young People look like, and how should it be enforced? (Why) should we have one? How should we use one–or its pursuit–in AI ethics education for and with young people?. 
N1  - C8. With the recent flurry of discussion about AI in education, it is easy to forget that AI has been influencing our lives for quite some time. 
N1  - C9. Our role as caring adults is to leverage our status and resources to lift up the voices and perspectives of young people: to consider them capable and worthy of shaping the world; to dream of their potential but value them as they are; to provide them with access and opportunities to learn about technology and rights; and to make sure we are worthy of their trust, and to trust them with consequential contributions to policy. 
N1  - C10. We offer this set of principles for redesigning AI rights as one way that adults can open conversations with young people about AI in ways that are not inherently punitive. 
N1  - C11. We see a great deal of room for rightsbased work with youth and AI ethics, and we dream that these activities might help youth advocate for their own rights. 
N1  - D. Findings. 
N1  - D1. American, 32% White, 18% Asian, 10% Hispanic/Latine, 2% Native American ● Male 44%, Female 56% ● From 15 area high schools including magnet high school (50%), comprehensive high school (44%), charter high schools (4%), and home school (2%).

N1  - E14. AI Ethics And Education. 
N1  - E15. The paper discusses the importance of involving young people in AI ethics discussions and policy-building, particularly in determining and advocating for students' rights.. 
N1  - E16. The authors highlight the need for a rights-based approach to AI ethics, using the White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights as a starting point.. 
N1  - E17. They also emphasize the importance of integrating student insights and perspectives into ethics frameworks that guide AI applications.. 
N1  - E18. Co-Designing AI Ethics With Young People. 
N1  - E19. The authors report on their empirical work with middle and high school students, which involved redesigning pieces of the AI Bill of Rights to make them more accessible and relevant to young people.. 
N1  - E20. They present lessons learned from working with young people to redesign AI ethics principles and offer suggestions for others looking to engage in similar work.. 
N1  - E21. AI Ethics And Policy. 
N1  - E22. The paper reviews foundational work on AI ethics, including the various ways the term is used in popular and academic discourse.. 
N1  - E23. The authors also discuss the current state of AI-related laws and policies, particularly in the United States, and highlight the importance of a comprehensive approach to AI ethics that takes into account the needs and perspectives of young people.. 
N1  - E24. Ai Ethics In Education. 
N1  - E25. Concerns about AI ethics in education are growing, with a focus on student safety, plagiarism, and cheating, particularly with generative AI tools like ChatGPT (Blose, 2023; Wood &amp; Kelly, 2023).. 
N1  - E26. However, there is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness and equity of these measures (Weinstein, 2020).. 
N1  - E27. Additionally, there is a need for education around AI ethics itself, including critical literacy practices that address AI specifically (Elwood, 2023; Sen &amp; Bennett, 2022).. 
N1  - E28. Co-Design And Youth Participation. 
N1  - E29. The authors advocate for a co-design approach that involves young people in the design of educational innovations, particularly technology-enhanced tools and systems (Penuel et al, 2007).. 
N1  - E30. This approach centers youth voices and involves them as active, agentic participants in the research and development process (Penuel, 2019).. 
N1  - E31. Co-design entails a tangible challenge, shared experience, and outcome flexibility that iteratively integrates partner ideas and conceptualizations of the tool or system (Roschelle et al, 2006).. 
N1  - E32. Research And Pedagogy. 
N1  - E33. The authors draw on theories that privilege youth participation, advocacy, and creativity, including critical (digital) literacies scholarship and practice (Garcia et al, 2015; Pangrazio, 2016).. 
N1  - E34. They also emphasize the importance of speculative thinking as a pedagogical approach, through critical consumption and production of various media forms (Chang et al, 2022; Cox, 2021; Payne, 2019).. 
N1  - E35. The authors report on three cases that illustrate key developments in their exploration of AI ethics with young people, including the redesign of the AI Bill of Rights for Young People.. 
N1  - E36. Power And Agency. 
N1  - E37. Students felt a lack of power and agency in their lives, particularly in relation to technology and data privacy.. 
N1  - E38. They internalized deficit views of their knowledge and capabilities, with some students believing that minors are not as smart as adults and lack the ability to make changes.. 
N1  - E39. However, some students saw themselves as potentially having power in the future, especially if they could "go viral" or be part of a collective action.. 
N1  - E40. The concept of "going viral" was seen as a joint human and machine (collective) action that could lead to change.. 
N1  - E41. Data Privacy And Surveillance. 
N1  - E42. Students felt a lack of control over their data and its uses, whether due to AI processes or school requirements.. 
N1  - E43. They were concerned about surveillance software installed on school-issued laptops, which allowed teachers to track their activity and control their screens.. 
N1  - E44. Students felt that this surveillance was an invasion of privacy and was not equally applied to everyone, with those who brought their own devices not being subject to the same level of surveillance.. 
N1  - E45. Teaching Practices And AI Ethics. 
N1  - E46. The study highlights the importance of teaching practices in encouraging students to exercise their power and engage with AI ethics.. 
N1  - E47. The use of the Blueprint and other activities helped students learn about ethics and AI, and encouraged them to take responsibility for clearing up biases and prejudices in AI systems.. 
N1  - E48. The study suggests that teachers and curriculum designers have a tremendous responsibility to ensure that technology use protects students' data privacy and promotes their agency and power.. 
N1  - E49. Activity Design And Student Understanding. 
N1  - E50. The activity of creating posters on AI ethics principles revealed that the Blueprint was unsuited for middle schoolers, with students struggling to understand technical jargon and needing more scaffolding or direct instruction to simplify the language (In our current study, we are pairing high school students and middle school students to accomplish this kind of task).. 
N1  - E51. Students had difficulty identifying and sharing examples from their own lives, except when the issue was discussed as a whole group, indicating a possible need for more support in finding relatable examples.. 
N1  - E52. The activity design was improved by asking students to workshop others' re-wordings, highlighting words with special meanings, and providing more guidance on finding examples.. 
N1  - E53. Student Agency And Co-Design. 
N1  - E54. The activity allowed students to demonstrate creativity, research skills, and a passion for justice, which are valued in the redesign of the activity.. 
N1  - E55. Students were able to redesign the Blueprint to be more accessible and relevant to their lives, using their own language and examples.. 
N1  - E56. The Double Diamond design process was used to guide the students in their redesign, emphasizing divergent and convergent thinking.. 
N1  - E57. Lessons Learned And Future Directions. 
N1  - E58. The impact of group work on students' understanding and the role of metacognitive reflection in the Define phase should be considered in future implementations.. 
N1  - E59. The use of preexisting templates may have limited creative decision-making options, but allowed students to focus on the content of their principle.. 
N1  - E60. The connections between design/text production and students' senses of ownership, agency, and understanding of their chosen issue should be explored further.. 
N1  - E61. Challenges. 
N1  - E62. Interdisciplinarity: Working at the intersection of complex ideas, such as youth agency, rights, and AI, can be challenging due to different disciplinary languages and paradigms (Caraballo, 2022).. 
N1  - E63. Obscure and changing AI: AI is not always obvious, and its consequences are not always clear, making it difficult for students to develop rights around it (Burriss, 2023).. 
N1  - E64. Youth status in schooling: There is a tension between the rights children are granted and the sense of agency they experience, with students often feeling powerless (D'Ignazio and Klein, 2020).. 
N1  - E65. Principles For Redesigning AI Rights With Students. 
N1  - E66. Leverage power to center youth perspectives: Adults should use their authority to support young people in making their needs, desires, and opinions heard and consequential (Youth Participatory Action Research methodology).. 
N1  - E67. Fashion local ideas: The Blueprint is too general and lacks context-specific language, so adults should help students adapt it to their local context (Roschelle et al, 2006).. 
N1  - E68. Provide background information: Students need background information to contribute to discussions, including understanding AI and ethics, and adults should provide access to this information (Burriss, 2023).. 
N1  - E69. Consider excluded perspectives: Adults and students should consider whose perspectives might be left out of the discussion, echoing the "examine power" data feminism principle (D'Ignazio and Klein, 2020).. 
N1  - E70. Student-Centered Approach. 
N1  - E71. The paper emphasizes the importance of foregrounding students' perspectives and work in discussions about AI technology in their lives.. 
N1  - E72. Students should be encouraged to explore exclusions, including those they personally experience, and consider how people of different ages, races, genders, and social status might need special consideration.. 
N1  - E73. Educators should provide access to diverse perspectives and help students identify whose perspectives might be left out in the process.. 
N1  - E74. Principles For Redesigning AI Policies. 
N1  - E75. The paper offers five principles to guide work with students to redesign AI policies, especially those that take a rights-based approach:. 
N1  - E76. + Center and support young people. 
N1  - E77. + Contextualize in your community. 
N1  - E78. + Support creative production. 
N1  - E79. + Build (on) background knowledge. 
N1  - E80. + Seek missing and diverse perspectives. 
N1  - E81. These principles are not exhaustive nor prescriptive, but can serve as an initial "blueprint" for building ways for young people to get involved in consequential conversations about AI.. 
N1  - E82. Importance Of Critical Examination. 
N1  - E83. The paper highlights the need for critical examination of AI's influence and its impact on education, emphasizing the importance of considering the perspectives of young people in shaping the world.. 
N1  - E84. The authors argue that educators should leverage their status and resources to lift up the voices and perspectives of young people and provide them with access and opportunities to learn about technology and rights.
