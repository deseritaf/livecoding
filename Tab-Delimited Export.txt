For teachers, how to skillfully apply AI in teaching and improve their AI literacy has become a necessary goal for their sustainable professional development. This research examines the correlations among the dimensions of AI literacy of teachers in order to promote the effectiveness of class teaching and the adoption of artificial intelligence literacy (AIL). Our findings are based on the analysis of 1013 survey results, where we tested the level of AI literacy of teachers, including Knowing and Understanding AI (KUAI), Applying AI (AAI), Evaluating AI Application (EAIA), and AI Ethics (AIE). We find that AAI had a significant, positive effect on the other three dimensions. Thus, based on the analysis, the government should take action to cultivate teachers’ AI literacy. In order to improve teachers’ AI literacy, the choice of curriculum, content, methods, and practical resources for special training should be diverse and committed to making AI literacy an essential enabler for teachers’ sustainable future development.

The aim is not to keep AI a black box and at the same time to be recognized as a transferable literacy with multiple learning benefits per age group of students. In order to strengthen this perspective, the design of workshops to introduce the basics of artificial intelligence to middle school students according to educational neuroscience principles is presented. With these workshops, the importance of AI literacy is emphasized, and students are given space for hands-on activities. The proposals are based on the axes of perception, representation and reasoning, learning, physical interaction, and social impact and include sections on Introduction to Machine Learning, Machine Learning Application Examples, Supervised Learning, and Training-Test Processes, Unsupervised Learning, and Machine Learning Algorithms.																	10.1109/seeda-cecnsm57760.2022.9932989

Previous work in AI ethics literacy have developed curriculum and classroom activities that engage learners in reflecting on the ethical implications of AI systems and developing responsible AI. There is little work in using game-based learning methods in AI literacy. Games are known to be compelling media to teach children about complex STEM concepts. In this work, we developed a competitive card game for middle and high school students called “AI Audit” where they play as AI start-up founders building novel AI-powered technology. Players can challenge other players with potential harms of their technology or defend their own businesses by features that mitigate these harms. The game mechanics reward systems that are ethically developed or that take steps to mitigate potential harms. In this paper, we present the game design, teacher resources for classroom deployment and early playtesting results. We discuss our reflections about using games as teaching tools for AI literacy in K-12 classrooms.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines or computer programs to imitate or perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as decision-making, speech or image recognition, and problem-solving. The purpose of this research is to analyze publications related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Middle Schools and to describe the characteristics of this research. The method used is descriptive bibliometric analysis. The Scopus database is used to obtain the necessary data. The research results show that publications have increased from 9 in 2021 to 20 in 2020. Publications in 2010 have been cited more than any other year. China is the most influential country in this field. Most publications on Artificial Intelligence research applied to high school students are at the Q1 rank, namely 25 journals. New themes in this field are machine learning and deep learning. Artificial Intelligence has not been directly connected with some third clusters keywords such as Artificial Intelligence Literacy, computer science education, and conception.

Previous research in AI education materials has largely focused on the introduction of terminology as well as AI use cases and ethics, but few allow students to learn by creating their own machine learning models. Therefore, there is a need for enriching AI educational tools with more  adaptable and flexible platforms for interested educators with any level of technical experience to utilize within their teaching material. As such, we propose the development of an open-source tool (Build-A-Bot) for students and teachers to not only create their own transformer-based chatbots based on their own course material but also learn the fundamentals of AI through the model creation process. The primary concern of this paper is the creation of an interface for students to learn the principles of artificial intelligence by using a natural language pipeline to train a customized model to answer questions based on their own school curriculums. The model uses contexts given by their instructor, such as chapters of a textbook, to answer questions and is deployed on an interactive chatbot/voice agent. The pipeline teaches students data collection, data augmentation, intent recognition, and question answering by having them work through each of these processes while creating their AI agent, diverging from previous chatbot work where students and teachers use the bots as black-boxes with no abilities for customization or the bots lack AI capabilities, with the majority of dialogue scripts being rule-based. In addition, our tool is designed to make each step of this pipeline intuitive for students at a middle-school level. Further work primarily lies in providing our tool to schools and seeking student and teacher evaluations.

Methods Based on a literature review of AI literacy, this study extracted AI-related components from the “Elementary and Middle School Artificial Intelligence Education Content Standards” developed by the Ministry of Education. Subsequently, AI content elements relevant to music were identified and selected, and corresponding performance expectations for elementary and middle school levels were formulated. These content elements and performance expectations were categorized into principles and applications, aligned with the three domains of AI literacy: understanding, applying, and critiquing. Results In the “Understanding” domain, participants grasped principles related to ‘Collection and Exploration of Music Data’ and ‘Visualization and Prediction of Music Data,’ which were then applied to activities fostering an understanding of ‘Music Elements and Characteristics through AI Utilization.’ Within the “Applying” domain, principles grounded in ‘AI Advancements and Diverse Musical Applications’ were employed for activities involving ‘Performance, Creation, and Appreciation through AI-Driven Music Engagement.’ In the “Critiquing” domain, principles concerning ‘Understanding Bias and Promoting Diversity in Music Data’ and ‘Ethics and Responsible Usage of AI in Music’ were identified. This section further encapsulates content elements and performance expectations that can be utilized to comprehend broader aspects of life and careers coexisting with AI in music, extending to the ‘Copyright and Artistic Value of AI-Generated Music Works.’ Conclusions The AI literacy-enriched music content elements and performance expectations developed in this study are expected to offer insights into the future direction of curriculum development and instructional strategies within the context of AI education. These contributions are anticipated to guide the implementation of music curricula that can effectively integrate with the evolving AI education landscape, shaping the trajectory of teaching and learning.						15982106 2671776x											10.22251/jlcci.2023.23.18.675

Then, how to define the connotation of junior high school students&#8217; artificial intelligence literacy, build a literacy evaluation framework, and provide decision support for students&#8217; information literacy level improvement is an urgent topic to be studied at present. Based on this, this study deeply analyzes the development context and connotation of artificial intelligence literacy and information literacy, and defines the connotation of literacy with emphasis on the uniqueness and independence of artificial intelligence literacy. Based on this, we design the evaluation framework of artificial intelligence literacy in junior high schools, and evaluate the artificial intelligence literacy level of junior high school students in Qingdao Artificial Intelligence Education Experimental Zone, China. The evaluation results show that the overall level of students&#8217; artificial intelligence literacy is high, but the development in four dimensions is uneven. There are significant differences in artificial intelligence literacy among junior middle school students with different gender, grade, class frequency, task cooperation frequency, learning value and goal, and self-efficacy. Finally, according to the evaluation results, this study puts forward the corresponding strategies to improve the quality of artificial intelligence.

195692	Journal article	Ojeda-Ramirez, Santiago\Ritchie, Daniel\Warschauer, Mark	AI Literacy for Multilingual Learners: Storytelling, Role-playing, and Programming		The CATESOL Journal	35(1)	0	2024	California Digital Library (CDL)		https://doi.org/10.5070/b5.35861				Artificial Intelligence technologies are becoming ubiquitous, transforming the workforce by altering or creating jobs and influencing decisions that affect minority communities. The necessity of AI literacy, comprising knowledge and skills for critical interaction with AI, is increasingly important. Multilingual learners, engaging with both every day and domain-specific vocabulary and syntax, must acquire AI literacy, necessitating tailored pedagogical practices. This article outlines three strategies implemented for multilingual middle school students during a summer camp in Southern California. We argue for a mutually beneficial relationship between acquiring second language proficiency and AI literacy. Supporting these processes, we present three pedagogical strategies: (1) storytelling to model AI decision-making, (2) role-playing as an AI to demonstrate programmability and learning from data, and (3) programming text-to-speech-to-text AI to illustrate sensor functionality and action-reaction concepts. Additionally, we discuss their alignment with AI competencies. These strategies potentially foster linguistic scaffolding and translanguaging, aiding multilingual learners in acquiring new literacies.						15350517											10.5070/b5.35861

There is a knowledge gap in how to prepare teachers to teach AI literacy in inclusive classrooms and how teacher-led classroom implementations can impact students. This paper reports a comparison study to investigate the effectiveness of an AI literacy curriculum when taught by classroom teachers. The experimental group included 89 middle school students who learned an AI literacy curriculum during regular school hours. The comparison group consisted of 69 students who did not learn the curriculum. Both groups completed the same pre and post-test. The results show that students in the experimental group developed a deeper understanding of AI concepts and more positive attitudes toward AI and its impact on future careers after the curriculum than those in the comparison group. This shows that the teacher-led classroom implementation successfully equipped students with a conceptual understanding of AI. Students achieved significant gains in recognizing how AI is relevant to their lives and felt empowered to thrive in the age of AI. Overall this study confirms the potential of preparing K-12 classroom teachers to offer AI education in classrooms in order to reach learners of diverse backgrounds and broaden participation in AI literacy education among young learners.						2159-5399								Query date: 2025-02-16 14:21:42			10.1609/aaai.v38i21.30380

Artificial Intelligence (AI) Usage and Its Influence to the Students’ Academic Writing: A Quantitative – Correlation Investigation		International Journal of Research and Innovation in Social Science	VIII(IV)	1621-1627	2024	RSIS International		https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2024.804216				This study dealt with the artificial intelligence (AI) usage and its influence on students’ academic writing. The primary goal of the study was to determine the level of artificial intelligence (AI) usage and students’ academic writing in terms of their respective indicators, the significant difference between artificial intelligence (AI) usage and students’, and what domains of artificial intelligence (AI) substantially influenced students’ academic writing. Also, this study utilized a quantitative-correlational design with 335 participants among Junior High School and Senior High School students in Lorenzo S. Sarmiento Sr. National High School. The average weighted mean, Pearson R, and multiple regression analysis were the statistical tools used in this study. Along with this, the results showed a high level of artificial intelligence (AI) usage in terms of satisfaction, AI literacy, relevance of AI, and confidence. Likewise, results showed a high level of students’ academic writing in terms of usefulness, ease of use, and attitude towards usage. In addition, there was a high correlation, and a significant relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) usage and its influence on the students’ academic writing. Hence, this led to the rejection of the null hypothesis. The domains of artificial intelligence (AI) usage that influenced students’ academic writing are the relevance of AI, confidence, and AI literacy. While satisfaction, as a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) usage, had no significant influence on students’ academic writing. Thus, educational institutions could harness the positive influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on students’ academic writing, creating a more technologically advanced, collaborative, and effective learning environment while encouraging students to participate in AI-assisted activities contributing to better progress and improved self-regulated learning as they interacted with AI tools and their peers in an academic setting.						24546186											10.47772/ijriss.2024.804216

We have mapped out a workflow for such applications and developed design narratives to investigate the implementation, modifications and temporal roles of the participants in the design process. Our results provide precedent knowledge on co‐designing with experienced and novice teachers and co‐constructing actionable insight that can help teachers engage more effectively with their students' learning and problem‐solving processes during classroom PBL implementations. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Success of educational technology depends in large part on the technology's alignment with teachers' goals for their students, teaching strategies and classroom context. Teacher and researcher co‐design of educational technology and supporting curricula has proven to be an effective way for integrating teacher insight and supporting their implementation needs. Co‐designing learning analytics and support technologies with teachers is difficult due to differences in design and development goals, workplace norms, and AI‐literacy and learning analytics background of teachers. What this paper adds We provide a co‐design workflow for middle school teachers that centres on co‐designing and developing actionable insights to support problem‐based learning (PBL) by systematic development of responsive teaching practices using AI‐generated learning analytics. We adapt established human‐computer interaction (HCI) methods to tackle the complex task of classroom PBL implementation, working with experienced and novice teachers to create a learning analytics dashboard for a PBL curriculum. We demonstrate researcher and teacher roles and needs in ensuring co‐design collaboration and the co‐construction of actionable insight to support middle school PBL. Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics researchers will be able to use the workflow as a tool to support their PBL co‐design processes. Learning analytics researchers will be able to apply adapted HCI methods for effective co‐design processes. Co‐design teams will be able to pre‐emptively prepare for the difficulties and needs of teachers when integrating middle school teacher feedback during the co‐design process in support of PBL technologies.

The derived lesson designs and teaching strategies suggest a limited use of artificial intelligence to ensure that learners using generative AI do not lose their creative autonomy. Methods Through a review of prior literature, an initial checklist for class design and a teaching strategy were developed. Subsequently, two rounds of internal validation were conducted with four experts. A creative class utilizing image-generating artificial intelligence was then implemented for 100 first-year middle school students in Seoul. The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated through pre- and post-tests of artificial intelligence literacy and interviews with the learners. Results Ultimately, 10 items for the class design checklist and 51 items for the teaching strategy were developed. The class design checklist included steps for ‘checking the usage environment’, ‘evaluating the class content’, and ‘assessing expertise’. The teaching strategy was structured into stages of ‘class preparation’, ‘understanding image-generating artificial intelligence’, ‘creative problem-solving’, and ‘class arrangement’. As a result of implementing these creative classes with image-generating artificial intelligence, there was a significant improvement in the students’ artificial intelligence literacy. Furthermore, both instructors and learners highlighted several benefits of these classes, such as the integration of artificial intelligence with various subjects, the enhancement of divergent thinking, firsthand experience with artificial intelligence principles and applications, opportunities for collaboration and discussion, and a strengthened understanding of copyright and ethical considerations. Conclusions The instructional class design checklist and teaching strategy developed in this study serve as cross-curricular guidelines applicable to various subjects that involve image creation, including Korean language, history, and art. Designing artificial intelligence convergence lessons with a focus on protecting learner’s creative autonomy can enable them to grasp the entire creative process and its inherent value. This approach goes beyond mere technical use, empowering learners to enhance their own creative expressions.						15982106 2671776x											10.22251/jlcci.2024.24.6.311

Methods Literature and prior research on artificial intelligence literacy, prompt engineering, Generative AI, and the development of English writing class models were analyzed. The model prototype's purpose and theoretical foundation were established, validated for internal consistency by five experts in educational technology and English education. The prototype was tested with one English teacher and approximately 48 students over a two-week period in December 2023, refining its content for the final model. Results To achieve this, 31 first-year middle school students in Seoul were assessed through pre- and post-tests to measure their attitudes toward artificial intelligence literacy and English writing. The final class model consisted of seven stages, distinguishing between learner, instructor, and Generative AI roles. Nine teaching strategies were applied to 39 detailed stages of the class model, aligning with instructional design principles. Conclusions The developed model holds significance in encouraging students' divergent questioning and proactive learning attitudes through strategic and systematic integration of Generative AI interaction within the English writing class. Moreover, through the development of this class model and teaching strategies, it is anticipated to serve as an effective guideline for educators to design and implement prompt engineering-based Generative AI integrated English writing classes.						15982106 2671776x											10.22251/jlcci.2024.24.6.135

The MBE program was the first-of-its-kind, focused on the intersection of neurobiology, psychology, and educational research and practice (Blake & Gardner, 2007; Fischer, 2009). Between its first cohort in 2004 and its final cohort in 2022, the program graduated 668 students from around the world (see Figure 1). Contemporaneously, scholars developed MBE or related Educational Neuroscience initiatives in several US states, Canada, the United Kingdom, Austria, The Netherlands, China, Israel, across Latin America, and other locations around the world. A central question in education revolves around what instructional approaches work for whom and under which conditions. MBE seeks to address these inquiries by leveraging cross-disciplinary methods and frameworks with rigorous scientific precision. Yet, the progression of scientific knowledge is often limited by the tools at hand. Herein lies one of the most significant contributions of MBE: It acts as a catalyst for methodological innovation, highlighting the limitations of current scientific approaches in tackling some of the most pressing educational challenges. The need to model the complex probabilistic relations that underlie educational response propelled innovation in the application of sophisticated computational techniques to highly dimensional student data. To illustrate, in a recent study, we used machine learning (ML) to improve methods of prediction of instructional responses in first-grade students at risk for reading disabilities (Shangguan et al., 2023; Zhongkai et al., Under Review). Due to challenges such as incomplete data from young participants, our initial ML models struggled to forecast student outcomes accurately. It wasn't until we integrated methods adapted from the fields of natural language processing and computer vision that we saw a significant uptick in accuracy. We trained our models to recognize hidden patterns between known and unknown data points, resulting in an enhanced out-of-sample prediction accuracy of 80%. In another example, innovative ML was applied to video recordings of math lessons to identify what teacher discourse features were important for supporting a positive learning mindset in students (Hunkins, Kelly, & D'Mello, 2022). In a different domain, the need for more ecologically valid neuroimaging to measure how cognitive and neural processes that underlie learning unfold in naturalistic settings, has facilitated the optimization of portable neuroimaging methods across a diverse range of contexts. For example, portable electroencephalography has been used to study student engagement during live classroom instruction (Davidesco, Matuk, Bevilacqua, Poeppel, & Dikker, 2021; Landi et al., 2019), and functional near-infrared spectroscopy has been used to document neural signatures of reading development in children growing in environments with a high risk of illiteracy, rural Côte d'Ivoire (Jasińska & Guei, 2018). The implementation of portable neuroimaging in these settings posed methodological challenges, and the response to those challenges fostered innovation. In-school EEG data collection is noisy, so the team has leveraged high-density EEG tools, which capture thousands of data points per second, combined with ML classifiers, to dissociate signal from noise. This allowed for a more precise characterization of individual differences in the neural substrates of reading as they unfold during instruction (Davidesco et al., 2021; Landi et al., 2019). To address the challenges of setting up a portable neuroimaging laboratory in low-resource contexts, researchers developed comprehensive protocols addressing problems such as high humidity and lack of Internet access (Jasińska & Guei, 2018). The advancement of these portable neuroimaging methods and the emergence of additional technologies, such as portable magnetic resonance imaging, can enable more equitable access to neuroimaging technologies around the world. Over the past 20 years, the MBE field has facilitated the expansion of empirical, translational, and policy-relevant work through a breadth of opportunities to bridge the mind, brain, and education sciences. Using mostly lab-based cognitive neuroscience approaches (but see Janssen et al., 2021), educational neuroscience researchers have examined the cognitive and neural bases of school-relevant skills. Not meant to impact the classroom directly, this research has elucidated the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie learning, such as basic processes in numerical cognition (Pollack & Price, 2019, 2020), the relation between math and reading (Pollack et al., 2021; Pollack & Ashby, 2018), and the connection of both with executive functioning (Marks et al., 2023). Connecting to classroom learning, MBE work has advanced understandings of education challenges across levels of analysis. For example, MBE work has evidenced the deleterious biological and psychological effects of racial/ethnic discrimination and how they undermine student performance and opportunities to thrive (Levy, Heissel, Richeson, & Adam, 2016; Shonkoff, Slopen, & Williams, 2021), and translated research for myriad education stakeholders (The Learning Scientists, 2023; https://bold.expert/). MBE's interdisciplinary approach has also informed policy. A synthesis of convergent evidence from biology, psychology, and education shows that adolescents benefit from starting school later (Watson et al., 2017), which provided strong evidence for California's 2022 implementation of later middle and high school start times (SB-328 Pupil Attendance: School Start Time, 2019). Alongside the expansion of MBE research, additional training and career development opportunities support the field's expansion, including the 2017 establishment of the IMBES Trainee Board by early career scholars (Gotlieb et al., 2019). The international proliferation of programs and centers (e.g., University of Alabama, Vanderbilt University, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, University of Graz, East China Normal University, University College London) has made joining the community easier. I am particularly enthusiastic about the field's potential moving forward. MBE stakeholders can expand research-practice partnership opportunities, emphasize learning from educational practice, and further increase access and representation in the questions we ask and who may answer them. Educators have long been aware of a simple fact: sparking a child's curiosity will help them learn (Deci & Ryan, 1981). Developmental psychologists have suggested that children's insatiable wonder is a critical drive in cognition that supports intuitive theory building and scientific reasoning (Gopnik, 2016; Keil, 2022; Schulz, 2012). Robotics, ML, and artificial general intelligence researchers have begun to build models with "curiosity" rewards to bootstrap learning (see Haber, 2022 for recent review). Psychological and computational theories link it to our need to resolve uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps (Gottlieb, Oudeyer, Lopes, & Baranes, 2013; Loewenstein, 1994). But until recently, formalizing exactly what curiosity is and how it relates directly to learning and the brain has remained less well understood (Kidd & Hayden, 2015). One of the most exciting developments in MBE has been new brain measures that might "tap into" and even provide explanation for the function and mechanisms underlying our drive to resolve uncertainty. In particular, EEG studies (measuring the electrical signals in the brain) have revealed several important connections between the theta oscillation brain signal and behavior: theta oscillations are involved in memory formation and reward; they are predictive of learning success; and, even in infancy, they are heightened preceding events that are predicted to reveal new information (see Begus & Bonawitz, 2020 for review). Such measures allow us to decouple previously confounded measures of curiosity and learning, such as the child's exploration (which can be influenced by factors beyond curiosity) and information gathered (which affects the inferences that can be drawn). We can then also understand how the child's current beliefs and preceding experiences (e.g., established knowledge, goals, and rapport with a teacher, see Bonawitz & Shafto, 2016) affect a learner's expectation of information and curiosity. And we can study more precisely how brain measures that might reflect curiosity then relate to attention, memory, and learning. Such explanatory models will allow us to understand better how to support curiosity in all learners. It is a very exciting time, as we are just at the precipice of building causal, theory-driven models of the role of curiosity in the mind and brain for education. Since the early 2000s, the field of MBE has continued to provide novel insights and perspectives across research-practice-clinic settings. The power of this research has been showcased in how we conceptualize learning differences, reading acquisition, and brain plasticity. With a focus on learning disabilities or difficulties, I draw on the example of dyslexia, a common reading disability that impacts the accuracy and/or fluency of single-word reading (Lyon et al., 2001; Lyon et al., 2003). One of the earliest contributions of cognitive neuroscience research was in establishing that dyslexia was indeed "neurobiological in origin," in that brain signatures for reading differ between groups of readers with and without dyslexia. Although seemingly elemental, this insight continues to act as a framework essential in reframing attribution for the difficulties faced by struggling readers (i.e., it was not based on laziness, limited aptitude, etc. as many continue to believe; Cortiella & Horowitz, 2014; Horowitz, Rawe, & Whittaker, 2017). Furthermore, the accumulated evidence that the "reading brain" is plastic, and changes in ways specific to the reading programs used (Eden et al., 2004; Yoncheva, Wise, & McCandliss, 2015), has redoubled the importance of providing evidence-based reading instruction to developing readers. MBE research has also converged with theories of learning (e.g., dynamic skills theory; Fischer & Bidell, 2006) to reveal that skill acquisition is dynamic, with the impact of reading instruction differing by student and environmental characteristics, as well as by academic calendar phases (i.e., during summer vacation; Romeo et al., 2018; Meisler et al., 2023). Insights from studies on reading abilities among individuals with distinct neural architecture (e.g., relying on a single hemisphere as a consequence of epilepsy-related surgery) have likewise emphasized the resilience of students and the multiple pathways to reading progress (Christodoulou et al., 2021; Katzir, Christodoulou, & DeBode, 2017). Across these types of contributions, MBE has advanced how we conceptualize learning and teaching. Looking ahead, MBE can harness the vast foundational knowledge now established to explore more complex and nuanced studies of children in contexts (e.g., examining the interactions of who a child is with what is being asked and in what context). Another potential for innovation is advancing toward MBE research that shifts away from group-based inquiries to individual differences models. Most importantly, MBE research will matter in the future when it is disseminated effectively, in a manner inclusive and representative of our populations of interest, and meaningful for the communities we serve as scientists. When the MBE field started to emerge, it had a number of bold ideas and hypotheses. For example, people were excited about the prospect of using neuroimaging to diagnose learning differences, characterize individual learning trajectories, or as a tool to identify who will subsequently struggle with learning to read or math. Furthermore, there was excitement about a direct translation of neuroimaging findings into the classroom using "brain-based curricula." Over the last 20 years, the field has learned a lot about neuroimaging methodology and its limitations and has also started to ask more refined questions and build relationships among the various stakeholders in the scientific and educational settings. As a result, evidence-based translational knowledge and scientifically trained changemakers have emerged (Solari et al., 2020; Ansari & Coch, 2006; Sheridan & McLaughlin, 2022; Thomas et al., 2019; Blakemore & Bunge, 2012; Gabrieli, 2016). In my opinion, the most significant impact of MBE on educational practice is at least twofold. First, we now understand that the development of academic skills and their precursors starts as early as in utero. Therefore, we need to understand a child's entire developmental trajectory (both generally and in key skills such as language and reading) in the context of variable environments to determine how, when, and where brains learn best (Ozernov-Palchik, Yu, Wang, & Gaab, 2016). Second, inspired by neuroscientific evidence that brain differences underlying disorders such as developmental dyslexia are present as early as infancy (Guttorm et al., 2005; Langer et al., 2017), the idea of "preventative education" is emerging, and early identification of children at risk for atypical developmental trajectories of academic skills is starting to get embraced (Fletcher et al., 2021; Gaab & Petscher, 2022; Catts & Petscher, 2022; Catts & Hogan, 2021; Ozernov-Palchik et al., 2016). All but 11 states in the United States have passed legislation for universal kindergarten literacy screening designed to identify children at risk for literacy-based disabilities (https://improvingliteracy.org/state-of-dyslexia). Education needs to continue to move from a reactive model to a proactive model, similar to shifts that happened in other fields that led to impactful practices such as preventative medicine (e.g., mammograms for breast cancer detection, Duffy et al., 2020). The field of MBE began with great excitement as modern neuroimaging techniques allowed for visualization and measurement of the brain bases of learning, how that develops from infancy through adulthood, and how that varies in different kinds of learners. It was, and is, thrilling to view the functional and structural brain bases of learning, the essence of education. In broad terms, MBE embraced the idea that, where possible, understanding and improving educational outcomes needs to be fueled by scientific evidence. For centuries, the understanding of the brain bases of learning was informed only by the study of adults with focal brain injuries. Now a neuroscience perspective could be brought directly to children and their developing brains, and to many aspects of education and learning, from reading to math and to broader cognitive skills, like executive functions, and social-emotional functions that support all kinds of learning. A change over time is that neuroimaging research has broadened its perspective from a focus on specific learning differences to consider also differences related to environmental factors, such as socioeconomic status, that have such broad impacts on education outcomes and opportunities (Mackey et al., 2015). One significant contribution of MBE was that powerful evidence became available for the brain bases of learning differences, such as dyslexia. Diversity among children's brains can make various aspects of learning to read easier or harder. Indeed, such differences are now documented for risk for dyslexia from infancy (Yu et al., 2022) through the start of school (Saygin et al., 2013) and for dyslexia through the years of schooling into adulthood. Further, the identification of differences in pre-readers opened up opportunities for early support that prevent severe struggles. Neuroimaging also revealed brain plasticity associated with helpful educational practices, which further supported the importance of such practices. In some cases, neuroimaging outperformed typical education measures in predicting future improvement in reading among children with dyslexia (Hoeft et al., 2011). The idea that brain measures, in combination with typical education measures, could help identify which student is most likely to benefit from alternative supports opens the possibility of more effective individualized education. The MBE field has had a profound and positive impact on education for neurodiverse students and their families. A learning difference diagnosis can describe a student's challenges, but it can also be perceived as overly prescriptive, limiting the potential for a student's future academic success. Neuroimaging studies have revealed that children with learning differences recruit alternative pathways and develop compensatory strategies to achieve success in the domain in which they are impaired (Yu et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2023). For students with diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or dyslexia, this idea that learning involves many concurrent processes is empowering: Even if a student faces some challenges, they can rely on other strengths and capabilities to find success. In my work as an educator, I have used the MBE approach as a tool for combating misleading claims about learning and the brain. As a music teacher, I have used my MBE background to help parents overcome misleading information about music and child development (like the so-called "Mozart effect") and instead provide more reliable insights about how early music exposure can help young children's developing speech and language (Tierney & Kraus, 2013; Zhao & Kuhl, 2016). With its focus on applying scientific evidence to inform educational practice, MBE helps educators to be more discerning consumers and effective stewards of information about learning and the brain. As an education funder for a global philanthropic organization, Porticus (2023), I have the privilege of learning from many nonprofit leaders, practitioners, public policymakers, and the like. From this bird's-eye view, I've witnessed a shifting interest in incorporating the learning and developmental sciences—the crux of MBE—into practice and policy. Perhaps the most revolutionizing contribution from MBE to the education sector has been an evidence-based understanding of the conditions required to support learning. Organizations like Turnaround for Children (https://turnaroundusa.org) convey the clear science that all children are born with brains that are ready to learn, that learning depends on conditions in the environment, and that we must design care and educational settings that enable children to thrive (Jensen et al., 2021; Troller-Renfree et al., 2022; Troller-Renfree et al., 2023). A sense of belonging, safe environment, supportive relationships, and a holistic approach to building student skills, mindsets, and autonomy are fundamental to learning (Caballero et al., 2019). The resources published by networks such as the Science of Learning and Development Alliance (2023) are critical to translating these scientific principles into actionable guides for implementation, like the Design Principles (Learning Policy Institute & Turnaround for Children, 2021). What excites me most is seeing these tenets being implemented in pockets across the globe. NGOs have been thought leaders in bridging the knowledge-practice gap. For instance, in addition to Turnaround, Transcend Education (https://transcendeducation.org) uses a community-driven R&D model to build school environments with evidence-based design and practices. These organizations and others are working with districts across the country, such as Washington DC Public Schools, to redesign systems with contextualized MBE principles embedded within their core operations. MBE has made a lasting contribution to education with the research-supported Universal Design for Learning framework (UDL; Rose & Meyer, 2002). UDL emphasizes diverse populations; it offers actionable guidelines for enacting change and the optimal design of educational experiences for all. UDL has permeated education practice and policy (e.g., Higher Education Opportunity Act, 2008; Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 2004) and influenced the design and implementation of educational materials, including curricula for Artificial Intelligence (AI) education (Walsh et al., 2022). The AI for K-12 initiative (AI4K12) highlights considerations for AI technology in education, such as biases in data that AI models use for training, issues of equity in AI, and societal impacts (Touretzky, Gardner-McCune, Martin, & Seehorn, 2019). In response, designers, researchers, and stakeholders use the UDL framework to make curricular materials accessible and engaging (Walsh & Dalton, 2022). In codesigning learning activities for an inclusive AI literacy curriculum, Responsible AI for Computational Action (https://raise.mit.edu/research-projects/inclusive-ai-literacy-learning/), I witnessed special needs teachers on the research team and field-based teacher partners cite UDL in their curriculum modifications, for example, the UDL principle of multiple modes of expression. Teacher partners modified a module in which students redesign a space and incorporate AI technology in an all-digital format to allow students to build physical miniature models of their envisioned room, which would help students articulate their designs and thoughts. UDL's translation from the research base to practical, actionable guidelines can facilitate the wide adoption of brain-science-informed learning design decisions among educators. As MBE evolves, we should celebrate its progress and continue to expand its mainstream adoption through the translation of cutting-edge research into practical applications and frameworks. Such translation can facilitate practitioners' and designers' uptake of these advancements, ultimately enhancing the inclusivity and equity of educational programs. In the last few years, I have observed a growing interest among educators (in North America and beyond) seeking knowledge on child development through cognitive neuroscience, focusing on mechanisms underlying behavioral outcomes. From early childhood education to college learning, schools often become children and adolescents' "second home" where they spend an extended amount of time. Educators and schools are active agents in shaping not only children's learning outcomes, but also their development. I had the pleasure of working with several educators who actively contributed to informing and designing our experiments. Furthermore, many of the doctoral students I worked with at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) were teachers and educators, creating synergetic collaborations merging their professional experiences with research. Personally, as a researcher engaging in both cognitive neuroscience and education research relating to multilingualism, embracing the MBE approach has changed me to be a better learner and listener. By spending time talking to educators at the state-, district-, and school-levels as a cognitive neuroscience researcher of language, I learned about their challenges and achievements from practitioner and policymaking perspectives. By observing Head Start classrooms and interacting with parents and educators, I listened to their concerns and gained a grounded perspective on child development. These voices enriched the way my research is framed and designed. For example, the shift from viewing multilingualism as a homogeneous group in state-level data (Luk & Kroll, 2019; Mancilla-Martinez, Oh, Luk, & Rollins, 2022; Yamasaki & Luk, 2018), and the shift to focus on outcomes to process and individual language experiences (Leon Guerrero, Whitford, Mesite, & Luk, 2021; Luk, 2022; Smith, Leon Guerrero, Surrain, & Luk, 2021) facilitate the understanding of learning mechanisms, which informs pedagogical strategies in linguistically diverse classrooms. I see the next stage of MBE being a two-way street, bringing researchers and stakeholders of education together, centering on child development and learning, and synergistically enriching scholarly knowledge, pedagogical practice, and educational policy. MBE-minded researchers, practitioners, and policymakers situated in different contexts aim to improve children's well-being by investing in MBE collaborations and synergy to transform cognitive neuroscience to be ecologically meaningful and relevant. Over the past two decades, I have witnessed an eagerness among educators to learn more about the brain and brain development and to explore how knowledge of brain development can inform the field of education. Embedded within this is a curiosity about how one studies human brain development and thus, an interest in learning more about the broad field of neuroimaging. In terms of what most excites me, several things come to mind. First, there have been major advances in our understanding of errors in brain development that lead to children struggling to learn to read (dyslexia; Norton, Beach, & Gabrieli, 2015), to master mathematics (dyscalculia; De Smedt, Peters, & Ghesquière, 2019), and to communicate socially (autism; Willsey & State, 2015). These errors can be genetic (e.g., single gene disorders such as Rett Syndrome or Fragile X Syndrome) or environmental (e.g., children experiencing profound neglect early in life, such as those abandoned in orphanages McLaughlin, Sheridan, & Nelson, 2017). For example, in one study, my colleagues and I demonstrated the causal effects of the caregiving environment on children's stress response during academic-like tasks (e.g., mental arithmetic; McLaughlin et al., 2015). Second, advances in neuroimaging have increasingly allowed us to identify children at risk for developmental disorders very early in life (e.g., work on the development of biomarkers that can be used as objective "readouts" of atypical development, before behavioral readouts become reliable). For example, across multiple studies, we found that atypicalities in brain function in infants can facilitate earlier identification of autism spectrum disorder (Bosl, Tager-Flusberg, & Nelson, 2018; Peck et al., 2021). MBE as a field has evolved considerably, and there continues to be a lot to be excited about! There have been substantial advancements in mechanistic descriptions of typical and disordered development across domains such as reading, mathematics, creativity, and social communication. Furthermore, MBE research has generated complementary neurobiological evidence in support of educational policies and practices, such as preventative universal literacy screening and a later school start time, to optimize learning and healthy development across the life span. While MBE has achieved notable progress in its two-decade existence, it continues to strive to fulfill its foundational promise of enhancing precision in risk identification, outcome prediction, and individualized education (Gabrieli, 2016). In closing this paper, we distill the insights from the individual contributions into three main challenges hindering MBE's influence on educational practice and policy: (1) inter-individual heterogeneity, (2) limited generalizability, and (3) gaps in the implementation of scientific evidence. We include some hopeful developments for addressing these challenges. For neuroscience to advance education, it is critical to understand how the nervous system relates to behavior by examining the associations between measures of the brain and variation in some behavior. Measures of brain and behavior, however, are complex, with multiple factors that influence their reliability (Elliott et al., 2020, 2021; Noble, Scheinost, & Constable, 2019; Zorowitz & Niv, 2023). Consequently, brain-behavior associations yield very small effect sizes and require enormous sample sizes (in the thousands!) to detect these effects reliably (Marek et al., 2022). To address issues of optimizing sample sizes and increasing reliability, the field has been moving toward multi-lab collaborations, resulting in consortia with thousands of participants (e.g., Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study; Volkow et al., 2018) and in-depth multi-session characterization of individuals using precision neuroimaging approaches (Grotton et al., 2022). These approaches will enable a comprehensive understanding of how the brain is related to behavior. The application of research findings across populations is critical for the advancement of knowledge, and in turn for the application of findings to diverse communities. As evident in the examples highlighted in the current paper, most MBE studies to date have been conducted in non-naturalistic lab settings, under tightly controlled conditions, and on nonrepresentative WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic; Henrich et al., 2010) populations. There has been a shift toward increased focus on engaging and training diverse communities in research and transitioning research from labs to schools and communities. Such efforts are necessary to establish the boundaries of generalizability of findings and determine what is true for what populations. Finally, the adoption of evidence-based practices in education has been impeded, in part, by a paucity of knowledge regarding factors that affect their implementation and sustainability in educational settings. Currently, there is an intensified focus on pinpointing the components of specific programs, discerning the barriers and facilitators across various educational contexts, understanding the structural characteristics of the participating institutions, and evaluating the individual factors of those targeted and those implementing the program, crucial for successful implementation and sustainability. Drawing from this work, the field has increasingly emphasized engagement in equitable and sustainable research collaborations with educators.

Consequently, the necessity for an AI ethics education program has become increasingly apparent. This study aims to investigate the influence of an experimental research study that developed and implemented an AI ethics education program for learners’ ethical awareness and attitude towards AI. The research methodology involved validating a model of the AI ethics education program by applying it to a group of 10 domain experts. Additionally, pre-test and post-test designs were employed with 17 middle school students as the experimental group. The same assessment was administered before and after the implementation of the AI ethics education program, and the data were analyzed using paired-sample t-tests. The findings of this study are as follows: Firstly, an AI ethics education program model was developed, incorporating key competencies such as AI literacy, critical thinking skills in AI, and AI problem-solving skills, all within the context of AI ethics. The implementation of this model was effective in the educational setting. Secondly, significant improvements were observed in the ethical awareness of middle school students across all domains after participating in the program. Thirdly, the attitudes of middle school students towards AI exhibited significant enhancements across all domains. These findings contribute to the broader field of AI ethics education by highlighting the importance of ethical awareness in AI and fostering favorable attitudes towards AI. The implications of this study are significant for the field of AI education.

However, adoption of these tools remains uneven, raising concerns about disparities in AI literacy and competency across geographic regions and educational contexts. Here we investigate the adoption of GenAI tools among second language (L2) educators in the United States, Colombia, Germany, and Macau—professionals uniquely positioned to benefit from and highlight barriers to GenAI integration. Using survey data, we assess four areas: accessibility of GenAI tools, teacher knowledge of potential applications, integration in teaching practices, and the nature of professional development provided. Our results indicated substantial intra- and inter-country variance, with U.S. and Colombian educators reporting higher familiarity and usage compared to those from Germany and Macau. Additionally, university and high school teachers were more likely to access professional development and leverage GenAI for tasks like assessment and differentiation than elementary or middle school educators, regardless of geographic setting. These disparities align with broader trends in AI adoption, reflecting heterogeneity in cultural attitudes, systemic barriers, and institutional support. Our findings highlight the critical need for targeted strategies that mitigate these emerging gaps in AI literacy, competency, and professional development.																	10.31235/osf.io/c5u8r_v1

A comprehensive framework to support them		Computers and Education Open	6	100171	2024	Elsevier BV		https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100171				Artificial intelligence (AI) education in K–12 schools is a global initiative, yet planning and executing AI education is challenging. The major frameworks are focused on identifying content and technical knowledge (AI literacy). Most of the current definitions of AI literacy for a non-technical audience are developed from an engineering perspective and may not be appropriate for K–12 education. Teacher perspectives are essential to making sense of this initiative. Literacy is about knowing (knowledge, what skills); competency is about applying the knowledge in a beneficial way (confidence, how well). They are strongly related. This study goes beyond knowledge (AI literacy), and its two main goals are to (i) define AI literacy and competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self-reflective mindsets, and (ii) propose a more comprehensive framework for K–12 AI education. These definitions are needed for this emerging and disruptive technology (e.g., ChatGPT and Sora, generative AI). We used the definitions and the basic curriculum design approaches as the analytical framework and teacher perspectives. Participants included 30 experienced AI teachers from 15 middle schools. We employed an iterative co-design cycle to discuss and revise the framework throughout four cycles. The definition of AI competency has five abilities that take confidence into account, and the proposed framework comprises five key components: technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self-reflection. We also identify five effective learning experiences to foster abilities and confidences, and suggest five future research directions: prompt engineering, data literacy, algorithmic literacy, self-reflective mindset, and empirical research.		http://qspace.qu.edu.qa/bitstream/10576/55957/1/1-s2.0-S2666557324000120-main%20%282%29.pdf				26665573											10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100171				1-s2.0-S2666557324000120-main%20%282%29.pdf

However, many developing countries lack the basic infrastructure needed for taking advantage of AI systems, which could worsen the new technological, economic, and social divides. Ensuring the inclusion and equity of AI in education is one of the challenges that we need to solve. How can we support the urgent needs of developing countries and the underprivileged communities so that the divide between “haves” and “have-nots” will not continue to grow? This is the core question that this project is trying to address. This paper introduces the AI-robotics project focusing on developing an open-source affordable AI-robotics tool to address the need to promote AI literacy around the world. CogBots, the AI-empowered educational learning tool, has been in development collaboratively with Google, CogLabs and UNESCO. The project targets upper elementary and middle school students to promote AI literacy, including the 5 Big Ideas in AI, using the AI-powered educational robotics tool and the Teachable Machine by Google Creative Lab providing a machine learning experience.		https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-77022-8_7.pdf				9783030770211											10.1007/978-3-030-77022-8_7				10.1007%2F978-3-030-77022-8_7.pdf

To empower children growing up with AI to navigate society's evolving sociotechnical context, we developed three middle school AI literacy curricula: Creative AI, Dancing with AI, and How to Train Your Robot. In this paper we discuss how we leveraged three design principles-active learning, embedded ethics, and low barriers to access - to effectively engage students in learning to create and critique AI artifacts. During the summer of 2020, we recruited and trained in-service, middle school teachers from across the United States to co-instruct online workshops with students from their schools. In the workshops, a combination of hands-on unplugged and programming activities facilitated students' understanding of AI. As students explored technical concepts in tandem with ethical ones, they developed a critical lens to better grasp how AI systems work and how they impact society. We sought to meet the specified needs of students from a range of backgrounds by minimizing the prerequisite knowledge and technology resources students needed to participate. Finally, we conclude with lessons learned and design recommendations for future AI curricula, especially for K-12 in-person and virtual learning.

The workshop featured the 30-hour "Developing AI Literacy" or DAILy curriculum that is grounded in literature on child development, ethics education, and career development. The participants in the workshop were students between the ages of 10 and 14; 87% were from underrepresented groups in STEM and Computing. In this paper we describe the online curriculum, its implementation during synchronous online workshop sessions in summer of 2020, and preliminary findings on student outcomes. We reflect on the successes and lessons we learned in terms of supporting students' engagement and conceptual learning of AI, shifting attitudes toward AI, and fostering conceptions of future selves as AI-enabled workers. We conclude with discussions of the affordances and barriers to bringing AI education to students from underrepresented groups in STEM and Computing.		https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3408877.3432513															10.1145/3408877.3432513				3408877.3432513
122886	Journal article	Shim, Jae Young\Choi, Saeeun	A Case Study of the Use of Artificial Intelligence in a Problem-Based Learning Program for the Prevention of School Violence		Human Ecology Research	61(1)	15-28	2023	The Korean Home Economics Association		https://doi.org/10.6115/her.2023.002				The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate the use of Artificial Intelligence in the prevention of violence among middle-school students. The sample for this study consisted of 20 first-year middle-school students who participated in theme selection activities in a free semester program as part of their home economics studies. The data for the study consisted of nine class observation logs, four group activity outputs, 30 class results, an online survey, and in-depth interviews with three students. A program called “R.U.OK” was developed by setting problematic situation for school violence prevention linked to the contents of the Home Economics Education(HEE) curriculum. After the program was implemented, the survey on the students’ class satisfaction content elements, with AI-based learning activities and PBL and interest, displayed high points, with an average of 4.0 or higher. Our qualitative analysis produced four significant results. First, students’ concerns about school violence had increased and they showed a change in attitude, having more empathy with friends and more interest in their surroundings. Second, digital and AI literacy had improved, and students’ interest in digital media learning had increased. Third, there had been an improvement in problem-solving ability in terms of being able to think more critically and independently. Fourth, the results also demonstrated that there had been a positive effect on self-direction and an improved capacity for teamwork. This study was significant in demonstrating the effectiveness of a program for the prevention of school violence based on the use of digital technology in the educational environment.		http://her.re.kr/upload/pdf/her-61-1-15.pdf				29825725 29826608											10.6115/her.2023.002				her-61-1-15.pdf

To achieve this objective, a 10-session AI-consumer life integration education program was developed by analyzing literature on AI Literacy, AI curriculum, consumer education, and the home economics curriculum for the middle school consumer life area. The program’s validity was assessed by nine teachers using a four-point Likert scale. The average scores for each item and the content validity index (CVI) were calculated. Based on expert feedback, the program was revised and improved accordingly. The expert validity assessment of the lesson plans, teaching materials and learning resources resulted in an average score of 3.78 for all items and an average CVI of 0.96. For the overall program, the expert validity assessment yielded an average score of 3.72 for all items and an average CVI of 0.97. Since the content validity index for all questions was above 0.78, the program demonstrated high validity across achievement standards integration, learning objectives, content and teaching methods, motivation, and volume areas. This confirms its effectiveness as an educational program for enhancing AI literacy. This study is significant in terms of defining and identifying the components of AI literacy, developing an AI-integrated program encompassing the entire consumer life area and confirming the suitability of the home economics curriculum for enhancing digital consumer competencies and promoting sustainable consumption. Additionally, it highlights the potential to integrate AI into the home economics and consumer life area.		http://her.re.kr/upload/pdf/her-62-3-517.pdf				29825725 29826608											10.6115/her.2024.036				her-62-3-517.pdf

Furthermore, AI-enhanced technologies and tools are no strangers in the field of education. It is more evident that it is important to prepare K-12 population of students for their future professions as well as citizens capable of understanding and utilizing AI-enhanced technologies in the future. In response to such needs, the authors started a collaborative project aiming to provide a K-12 AI curriculum for Japanese students. However, the authors soon realized that it is important to contextualize the learning experience for the targeted K-12 students. The paper aims at introducing the idea of contextualizing AI education and learning experience of K-12 students with examples and tips using the work-in-progress version of the contextualized curriculum using culturally responsive approaches to promote the awareness and understanding of AI ethics among middle school students.

However, educating young learners to become AI literate citizens poses several challenges. The components of AI literacy are ill-defined and it is unclear to what extent middle school students can engage in learning about AI as a sociotechnical system with socio-political implications. In this paper we posit that students must learn three core domains of AI: technical concepts and processes, ethical and societal implications, and career futures in the AI era. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Developing AI Literacy (DAILy) workshop that aimed to integrate middle school students' learning of the three domains. We found that after the workshop, most students developed a general understanding of AI concepts and processes (e.g., supervised learning and logic systems). More importantly, they were able to identify bias, describe ways to mitigate bias in machine learning, and start to consider how AI may impact their future lives and careers. At exit, nearly half of the students explained AI as not just a technical subject, but one that has personal, career, and societal implications. Overall, this finding suggests that the approach of incorporating ethics and career futures into AI education is age appropriate and effective for developing AI literacy among middle school students. This study contributes to the field of AI Education by presenting a model of integrating ethics into the teaching of AI that is appropriate for middle school students.
