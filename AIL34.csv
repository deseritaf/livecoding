The derived lesson designs and teaching strategies suggest a limited use of artificial intelligence to ensure that learners using generative AI do not lose their creative autonomy. Methods Through a review of prior literature, an initial checklist for class design and a teaching strategy were developed. Subsequently, two rounds of internal validation were conducted with four experts. A creative class utilizing image-generating artificial intelligence was then implemented for 100 first-year middle school students in Seoul. The effectiveness of this approach was evaluated through pre- and post-tests of artificial intelligence literacy and interviews with the learners. Results Ultimately, 10 items for the class design checklist and 51 items for the teaching strategy were developed. The class design checklist included steps for ‘checking the usage environment’, ‘evaluating the class content’, and ‘assessing expertise’. The teaching strategy was structured into stages of ‘class preparation’, ‘understanding image-generating artificial intelligence’, ‘creative problem-solving’, and ‘class arrangement’. As a result of implementing these creative classes with image-generating artificial intelligence, there was a significant improvement in the students’ artificial intelligence literacy. Furthermore, both instructors and learners highlighted several benefits of these classes, such as the integration of artificial intelligence with various subjects, the enhancement of divergent thinking, firsthand experience with artificial intelligence principles and applications, opportunities for collaboration and discussion, and a strengthened understanding of copyright and ethical considerations. Conclusions The instructional class design checklist and teaching strategy developed in this study serve as cross-curricular guidelines applicable to various subjects that involve image creation, including Korean language, history, and art. Designing artificial intelligence convergence lessons with a focus on protecting learner’s creative autonomy can enable them to grasp the entire creative process and its inherent value. This approach goes beyond mere technical use, empowering learners to enhance their own creative expressions. </jats:p>","2024-03-31","2025-02-17 01:19:17","2025-02-17 01:19:17","","311-331","","6","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Korean Association For Learner-Centered Curriculum And Instruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a knowledge gap in how to prepare teachers to teach AI literacy in inclusive classrooms and how teacher-led classroom implementations can impact students. This paper reports a comparison study to investigate the effectiveness of an AI literacy curriculum when taught by classroom teachers. The experimental group included 89 middle school students who learned an AI literacy curriculum during regular school hours. The comparison group consisted of 69 students who did not learn the curriculum. Both groups completed the same pre and post-test. The results show that students in the experimental group developed a deeper understanding of AI concepts and more positive attitudes toward AI and its impact on future careers after the curriculum than those in the comparison group. This shows that the teacher-led classroom implementation successfully equipped students with a conceptual understanding of AI. Students achieved significant gains in recognizing how AI is relevant to their lives and felt empowered to thrive in the age of AI. Overall this study confirms the potential of preparing K-12 classroom teachers to offer AI education in classrooms in order to reach learners of diverse backgrounds and broaden participation in AI literacy education among young learners.</jats:p>","2024-03-24","2025-02-17 01:19:17","2025-02-17 01:21:56","","23318-23325","","21","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)","","; ; /Users/des/Zotero/storage/LSZ38C9A/Zhang et al. - 2024 - An Effectiveness Study of Teacher-Led AI Literacy Curriculum in K-12 Classrooms.pdf","https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/30380/32443; https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i21.30380","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The major frameworks are focused on identifying content and technical knowledge (AI literacy). Most of the current definitions of AI literacy for a non-technical audience are developed from an engineering perspective and may not be appropriate for K–12 education. Teacher perspectives are essential to making sense of this initiative. Literacy is about knowing (knowledge, what skills); competency is about applying the knowledge in a beneficial way (confidence, how well). They are strongly related. This study goes beyond knowledge (AI literacy), and its two main goals are to (i) define AI literacy and competency by adding the aspects of confidence and self-reflective mindsets, and (ii) propose a more comprehensive framework for K–12 AI education. These definitions are needed for this emerging and disruptive technology (e.g., ChatGPT and Sora, generative AI). We used the definitions and the basic curriculum design approaches as the analytical framework and teacher perspectives. Participants included 30 experienced AI teachers from 15 middle schools. We employed an iterative co-design cycle to discuss and revise the framework throughout four cycles. The definition of AI competency has five abilities that take confidence into account, and the proposed framework comprises five key components: technology, impact, ethics, collaboration, and self-reflection. We also identify five effective learning experiences to foster abilities and confidences, and suggest five future research directions: prompt engineering, data literacy, algorithmic literacy, self-reflective mindset, and empirical research.","2024","2025-02-17 01:19:17","2025-02-17 01:21:08","","100171-100171","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","; ","http://qspace.qu.edu.qa/bitstream/10576/55957/1/1-s2.0-S2666557324000120-main%20%282%29.pdf; http://hdl.handle.net/10576/55957","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the summer of 2020, we recruited and trained in-service, middle school teachers from across the United States to co-instruct online workshops with students from their schools. In the workshops, a combination of hands-on unplugged and programming activities facilitated students' understanding of AI. As students explored technical concepts in tandem with ethical ones, they developed a critical lens to better grasp how AI systems work and how they impact society. We sought to meet the specified needs of students from a range of backgrounds by minimizing the prerequisite knowledge and technology resources students needed to participate. Finally, we conclude with lessons learned and design recommendations for future AI curricula, especially for K-12 in-person and virtual learning.","2022-08-01","2025-02-17 01:19:18","2025-02-17 01:21:45","","1-383","","2","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Netherlands Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC","","; ; ; /Users/des/Zotero/storage/UMLW572E/Williams et al. - 2022 - AI + Ethics Curricula for Middle School Youth Lessons Learned from Three Project-Based Curricula..pdf; ","https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/144260/1/40593_2022_Article_298.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00298-y; https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/144260; https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40593-022-00298-y.pdf","AI Literacy; Artificial Intelligence (AI); Constructionism; Curriculum; Middle-school; Online Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To validate the developed model, two rounds of expert validation were conducted with three experts in educational technology and AI-integrated education. Additionally, a class was conducted with six middle school students from a gifted education institute, where problems, solvable through a regression analysis model of supervised learning, were explored, and their responses were evaluated. The results indicate that the model can enhance problem formulation competency, AI literacy, and creative thinking skills, while also fostering knowledge in mathematics and information. The significance of this model lies in its ability to systematically design AI convergence courses for improving problem formulation competency.</jats:p>","2024-06-30","2025-02-17 01:19:19","2025-02-17 01:19:19","","17-43","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Korean Society for Creativity Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Applications of, and media generated by generative AI techniques are abundantly present on social media platforms frequented by children, who are not yet aware of the existence of AI-manipulated media. Previous work has highlighted the importance of digital media literacy and AI literacy for children. In this work, we introduce middle school students to generative AI techniques as a tool for creation, while also focusing on critical discussion about their societal and ethical implications, and encouraging pro-activeness in being responsible consumers, creators and stakeholders of technology. We present learning activities that introduce 38 middle-school students to generative modeling, how it is used to generate Deepfakes, cues that help to recognize Deepfakes, and the spread and effects of misinformation. Students demonstrated an understanding that generative media may be believable, but not necessarily true, and can contribute to the spread of misinformation. They were also able to identify why misinformation may be harmful or lasting, drawing specific examples to social settings that indicate human-centered implications. Finally, students expressed opinions about policies surrounding the presence of Deepfakes on social media. This approach can be adopted to introduce students to other technical systems that constitute both productive applications and potential negative implications of technology.

This study examined the influence of a case-based AI professional development (PD) program on AI integration strategies and AI literacy among seven middle school science teachers. Employing three distinct case problems, from well-structured to ill-structured, the AI PD program aimed to stimulate teachers' reflection on AI literacy development and encourage the construction of problem-solving and AI integration strategies within various pedagogical contexts. Analysis of video-recorded case discussions revealed that teachers primarily drew on personal experiences for collaborative problem-solving across the three cases. However, the complexity of the case problems influenced their approach to knowledge co-construction, and dealing with ill-structured problems promoted the application of new knowledge. Through analyzing the survey data, we found a marked increase in teachers' AI literacy, particularly in the domain of knowing and understanding AI, suggesting a pivotal role for direct instruction that supports AI literacy growth. However, their application of this AI knowledge was limited during the case discussions, while other domains of teacher AI literacy were more frequently employed. The findings highlight the importance of combining direct instruction with case-based discussions in AI-related PD programs to bolster teacher AI literacy effectively. The research has implications for using a case-based learning approach during short-term PD initiatives and advocates the ongoing need for comprehensive AI literacy development to facilitate teachers' AI integration in subject-specific teaching.","2024","2025-02-17 01:19:19","2025-02-17 01:21:03","","100178-100178","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we developed a competitive card game for middle and high school students called ""AI Audit"" where they play as AI start-up founders building novel AI-powered technology. Players can challenge other players with potential harms of their technology or defend their own businesses by features that mitigate these harms. The game mechanics reward systems that are ethically developed or that take steps to mitigate potential harms.
